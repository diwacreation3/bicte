            <p class="texts">
                <b>A. Introduction</b> <br><br>
                The SSRP is a long –term strategic plan that describes the goals and
                objectives that will be pursued by the Government of Nepal (GON),
                Ministry of Education (MOE) over the period starting from the fiscal year
                2009/10 to till 2015/16. The plan comprises the key strategic interventions
                and the estimated financial resources required to implement these
                strategies. Education for All (EFA), Secondary Education Support
                Program (SESP), and Community School Support program (CSSP) and <br>
                Teacher Education Project (TEP), Building upon the lessons learnt and
                gains we have made in the sector, the SSRP also introduces new reforms
                characterized by strategic interventions such as the restructuring of school
                education, improvement in quality of education, and institutionalization
                of performance accountability. By putting forward these reform
                initiatives, the plan has placed emphasis on the access of the out of school
                populations and has guaranteed the learning of all children by raising
                efficiency and enhancing effectiveness in the delivery of services in the
                education sector <br><br>
                The SSRP has its roots in the EFA National Plan of Action 2001 to 15 the
                Three-Year Interim Plan and the SSR Core Document. The plan provides
                strategic framework for the Annual Strategic Implementation Plans
                (ASIP) and Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB). <br><br>
                The SSRP has been prepared by the MOE/GON based on the SSR, Core
                Document and the feedback received from stakeholder consultations
                conducted at different levels across the country. Key policy goals and
                values, such as rights to education, gender parity, inclusion, and equity
                have guided the plan preparation process and have been integrated as
                strategic interventions in the Plan. By implementing the Plan, the MOE
                aims to achieve significant improvements in the key SSR indicator
                <br><br>
            <h2>Major Themes of SSRP</h2>
            <p class="texts">
                <i>1. Early childhood education and development:</i> <br><br>
                The ECED goal stipulate in the EFA National plan of Action (2001-15)
                provides a basis for the implementation of ECED in the SSR plan. The
                goals and objectives of ECED are as follows: <br>
                <b>Goal:</b> To foster children’s all-round development, laying a firm
                foundation for basic education. <br>
                <b>objectives: </b> To expand access to quality ECED services for children of
                four years of age to prepare them for basic education. <br><br>
                <i>2. Basic Secondary education</i> <br><br>
                The basic and secondary education component in the SSR Plan has
                rendered priority, building upon the lessons drawn from past experiences
                such as the EFA. The emphasis of this component is to increase access to
                and participation in promote equity and social inclusion in, and improve
                quality and relevance of basic and secondary education. This plan has
                <br><br>
                given similar emphasis to institutionalization of decentralized governance
                and management system in education.
                To increase relevance of school education, the SSR plan intends to
                restructure current school system forming a coherent and integrated
                school structure with grades 1-12. However, to ensure access to all and to
                promote compulsory basic education, the basic education constitutes a
                priority in the plan. <br> The Plan has also endorsed the need to integrate and
                harmonize existing fragmentation at the higher secondary level by
                establishing co-operation between and among different education
                provides such as, the HSEB, CTEVE, and Universities.
                The goals and objectives of this program
            </p>
            <p class="texts">
                <b> Goal of basic education:</b> To ensure equitable access to
                quality education
                through a rights-based approach and promotion of a child friendly
                environment in schools <br><br>

                <b>Objectives of basic education: </b> To ensure equitable access to quality basic
                education for all children in age group 5 to 12.
                <br><br>
                <b> Goal of secondary education: </b> To meet the national
                development needs by
                producing competent and skilled human resources and to provide a sound
                foundation for tertiary education. <br><br>
                <b>Objectives of secondary education: </b>
                To improve access, equity, and
                quality and
                relevance of secondary education. <br><br>
                <i> 3. Literacy and lifelong learning</i>
                
                <br><br>
                Literacy and continuing education form the basis for lifelong learning for
                all youths and adults between 15 and 45 years of age. Literacy enables
                them to engage in lifelong learning and contributes to developing their
                capabilities to sustain the livelihoods and participation in the society. As
                part of lifelong learning, continuous and non-formal education caters to
                the need for literacy development and complements formal schooling. For
                the delivery of literacy and life-long learning programs, community
                Learning Centers have been established as a major strategic intervention.
                The plan, complementing the on-going National Literacy campaign,
                focuses on post literacy and continuing education. The goals and
                objectives of this program are:
                <br><br>
               <b> Goal:  </b>To develop life skills and facilitate continuous learning to youths and
                adults, with particular focus on female and disadvantaged
                populations. 
                <br><br>
                <b> Objectives: </b>
                To enhance functional literacy and basic competencies among
                youths and adults. <br><br>
                <i>4. Technical education and vocational training </i>
                
                The SSR plan provides policy directions for both general and vocational
                components in secondary education so that the opportunities for skill
                development will be expanded across the country. To identify appropriate
                models and approaches, this plan aims at testing and piloting different
                schemes of TEVT soft and intends to continue with the ongoing programs.
                Based on the experiences gained and lessons learned from the pilot and
                <br><br>
                testing, further expansion of TEVT will be worked out in secondary
                schools. The goal and objectives of this program are:
                <br><br>
               <b>Goal:</b>  To equip students with employable skills,
                which will assist and
                accelerate their transition from school to work and help them
                explore a variety of career opportunities that are available inside
                Nepal as well as in the neighboring countries and in the global
                market. <br><br>
                
                <b>  Objectives:</b> To equip secondary level students with TVET soft skills. <br><br>
                <i>5. Teacher professional development </i>
                
                The SSRP has given a highest priority in teacher preparation and its
                development. The major quality interventions as outlined in the SSRP rest
                upon the quality and efficiency of the teachers recruited. As such, the
                minimum qualifications of the teachers have been proposed to up-scale
                and at the same time, mandatory training requirements and regular
                updates have been planned. The goal and objectives of this program are:
                <br><br>
               <b>  Goal:</b> To ensure all teachers have
                the knowledge and skills required to
                effectively facilitate students learning processes.
                <br><br>
               <b> Objectives:</b>  To enhance teachers’ qualifications and
                professional
                competencies to better facilitate student learning processes.
                <i>6. Capacity development </i>
                
                The SSR core document has pointed out that it is crucial to develop the
                capacity of all implementing agencies to analyze, formulate, evaluate and
                translate policies into action as well as the capacity to perform assigned
                <br><br>
                roles and responsibilities. In this context, it is critical to assess
                performance gaps in the delivery of educational services and to design and
                implement relevant interventions for the effective implementation of the
                SSR plan. This requires developing an understanding of what good
                performance looks like and chart out a plan of action to enhance required
                competencies at the institutional, organizational and individual levels.
                The goal and objectives are:
                <br><br>
                <b>  Goal: </b>To enhance capacity for implementation the reform stated in the SSR
                plan. <br><br>
                <b>Objectives: </b>
                 To improve the performance of the MOE service delivery
                system and develop capacity to implement critical reforms. <br><br>
                <i>7. Monitoring and Evaluation </i>
                
                The main purpose of M&E is to improve service delivery through
                informed decisions by tracking achievements against SSR targets,
                objectives and goals at every level of service delivery and management.
                The information provided by the M&E system can be used to improve the
                planning and implementation processes and to assess the contribution of
                SSR to achieve national development goals. Three major M&E functions
                include:  <br>
                i. assessing compliance with acts and regulations. <br> ii. Measuring
                progress against milestones and targets; and III. Evaluate the impact of
                policies and strategies on sector goals and objectives. These M&E
                functions will be based on performance indicators and monitoring
                indicators. The goals and objectives of this program are:
                <br><br>
                <b> Goal: </b> To facilitate effective implementation of the plan through a system
                that supports informed decision making by providing timely information
                on the program status against planned objectives. <br><br>

                <b> Objectives:</b>  To monitor program inputs, processes, and outputs and
                evaluate the impact of the program.
                <br><br>
                <i>8. Financing </i>
                <br><br>
                The lessons learned from major program interventions such as EFA,
                SESP, and TEP provide a basis for financing the SSR plan. Important
                insights drawn for financing the plan include SIP based funding which has
                been instrumental in promoting participation and ownership through need
                based allocation of resources at the school level. Performance based
                funding is another major intervention which has created positive
                environment in schools in improving efficiency.
                The SSR plan introduces area that incur additional costs, other than the
                cost of continuing best practices inherited from the programs such as EFA,
                SESP, CSSP, TEP etc. To meet the additional costs, it is imperative to
                mobilize local resources such as grants from local governments including
                VDC’s, municipalities and DDC’s. <br><br>
                <i> 9. Aid management</i>
                <br><br>
                The MOE has prepared the SSR plan that stipulates the key school sector
                policies, reform agendas, priorities and strategies as well as processes for
                moving towards the institutionalization of result-based management
                principles. The aid management under the SSRP follows the principles
                <br><br>
                and guidelines as government’s ownership of the country development
                strategies, alignment to national management system, use of common
                arrangements and procedures, results oriented framework, and mutual
                accountability. The goals and objectives of this program are:
                <br><br><b> Goal: </b> 
                Effective mobilization of external resources and experience in
                achieving the national development goals in the education sector.
                <br><br><b> Objectives:</b>  To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of aid available
                for SSRP implementation
