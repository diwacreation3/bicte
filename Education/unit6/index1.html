                    defined and determined. </li>
                <li>The present education system is non-reproductive, backward societies
                    are not getting proper education and education is mainly loaded by
                    general education </li>
                <li> The present education system is not related to national aim. It is not
                    developing skills. More emphasis is being given on theoretical
                    knowledge. </li>
                <li> Education is bringing only quantitative change instead of qualitative
                    change. Textbooks, educational materials and evaluation system are
                    lacking quality. </li>
                <li> Educational institutions are increasing educational loss </li>
