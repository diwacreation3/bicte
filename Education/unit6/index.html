                In this chapter, we studied that although the history of education in Nepal
                can be extended up to the prehistoric period, the actual development of
                formal schooling begun with the establishment of Durbar School in 1910
                BS. Education in the Rana period was only for the elite groups so this
                period is also renounced as opposition period of education in the history
                of Nepal and the efforts for mass education in this country begun only
                after the political change in 2007 BS. The government appointed different
                commissions for suggesting policies of education in Nepal. Some of the
                prominent commissions appointed for this purpose are presented as under.

            Before 2007 BS, education in Nepal was very much unorganized.
            Although, there were very few educational institutions in the country,
            common people were getting only a little access to these institutions. The
            educational opportunity in 104 year–long Rana period was very much
            restricted to them. The people got a great opportunity for education after
            the end of the Rana rule in 2007 BS because the restriction for establishing
            <br><br>
            a school by the private sector was over after the end of this government.
            Therefore, there was a great zeal among people for opening schools and
            many schools were opened throughout the country at that time. Since, the
            education system in Nepal up to that time was not organized; there was a
            need of a police framework to direct the education system in Nepal.
            Sensing this need, the government appointed a forty six member
            commission under the chairpersonship of Sardar Rudra Raj Pandey on 9
            Chaitra, 2010 BS to provide the suggestions for the police of education in
            Nepal. Professor Huge B. Wood was the advisor of this commission and
            Trailokya Nath Upreti was the secretary of this commission. This
            committee included members of different important sectors of the nation.

            entitled as <i> “Education in Nepal.” </i> <br><br>
