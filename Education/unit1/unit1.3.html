            <p class="texts">
                Generally, Education means acquisition of knowledge, understanding, intelligence,
                conscience, wisdom etc. Common people think it is the process, which takes place in
                schools and college, and the person who has acquired a certificate from these
                institutions, can only be termed as educated. However, in real sense, it is not limited
                only to schooling. There is no limit of time, place and age for acquisition of
                knowledge or education. People can acquire education everywhere, in every
                moment of their life without the bound of age. They can receive education from
                every source such as schools, parents, society, peer circle, mass media etc. It can be
                planned or unplanned. The meaning of education can be discussed from the
                following perspectives:

                <b>1. Etymological meaning of Education</b>
                Etymology means the study of the origin and history of words and their meanings. It is
                the science of the origin and history of particular word. The English word" Education"
                comes from the Latin word " Educatum" , ' Educare', and ' Educere'. To find out the
                origination, meaning and history of these words is called etymological meaning of
                education.
                <br>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Educatum:</b> The Latin word Educatum consists of two Latin words' Edu' and'
                    catum'. Edu stands for 'internal' (out of) and catum means 'to lead out'. As such
                    Educatum means to bring all innate power and creativity of the learners or to
                    foster the innate potentialities of students by teaching and training.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Educare:</b> Educare consists of two words as 'E' and ducare.' E' means out of and
                    'ducare' means lead out. As such Educare means to educate, to bring up, to raise
                    or to nourish. </li>
                <li> <b>Educere:</b> Educere also consists of two Latin words as 'E' and 'Ducere'.' E' means'
                    out of' and ducere means' to lead out'. As such, Educere means to enhance the
                    ability of an individual by strengthening innate creativity and potentiality. </li>
                <li> <b>Shiksha:</b> in Nepali is derived from the word Sanskrit language. It is derived from
                    Sanskrit morpheme ' Shiksh' which means to' learn and to teach'. </li>
                <li> <b>Vidhya </b>is also a Nepali word which is derived from Sanskrit language. It is made
                    up of Sanskrit morpheme 'Vid' which means' to know. '
                    Based on etymological sources, it can be concluded that education is a
                    process, which brings the internal potentialities of a learner outside. It is the
                    process of training, raising the children and drawing out the fuller internal
                    ability of an individual. </li>
            </ol>

                <b>2. Narrower Meaning of Education</b> <br> <br>
                In the narrow sense, education is limited within the boundary of a school and college. It covers only
                the area of formal education. It is a process by which, a person acquires knowledge needed to fulfill
                the demand of job market. This type of education follows a definite curriculum and takes place in a
                formal institutions such as school, colleges etc. Only the people trained or taught in these
                institutions and who have received certificates as a mark of success can be considered as educated.
                This type of education as bookish knowledge, which may not be adequate for the overall
                development of learners. This type of education can be considered only as training or teaching. This
                type of education is teacher oriented and traditional type of teaching which is generally autocratic in
                nature. In fact, education, which is conducted within the limit of curriculum, subject matters,
                teaching duration, teaching procedures, teaching materials, evaluation process etc. irrespective of
                individual differences, needs, necessities, interests and aspirations, is regarded as narrow meaning
                of education. <br><br>

                <b>3. Wider meaning of Education</b> <br> <br>
                In wider sense, education refers to all aspects that a person learns, knows and experiences
                throughout his/her entire life. Education is not limited to the boundary of formal education. It is
                related to all the knowledge, skills and attitudes, which people acquire in the course of their life
                from various sources. It is not limited to certain duration of schooling only. It takes place throughout
                the life from the cradle to the grave. Institutions of formal education are not the only source of
                providing education. It can be acquired from any source, at any place and at any time. Education is
                life-long process. Education is re-construction and re-organization of experiences so it can be
                acquired from any sources. All the human experiences, which enable people to solve the problems
                of life and adjust them in society, can be considered as education.
