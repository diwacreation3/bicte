            <div class="title">1.2 Characteristics of Discipline</div>
            <p class="texts">
            <ul>
                <li> Disciplines then have to be considered to be considerable
                    barriers to free thinking and an obstacle to more self-governed
                    subjectivities, which became the focus of Foucault’s later work.</li>
                <li> The term ‘academic discipline’ certainly incorporates many
                    elements of the meaning of ‘discipline’ discussed above. At the
                    same time, it has also become a technical term for the
                    organization of learning and the systematic production of new
                    knowledge.</li>
                <li> Often disciplines are identified with taught subjects, but clearly
                    not every subject taught at university can be called a discipline. </li>
                <li> There is more to disciplines than the fact that something is a
                    subject taught in an academic setting </li>
                <li> In fact, there is a whole list of criteria and characteristics, which
                    indicate whether a subject is indeed a distinct discipline. </li>
            </ul>
            <b>A general list of character would include:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Disciplines have a particular object of research (e.g. law, society,
                    Politics), though the object of research may be shared with another
                    discipline. </li>
                <li>Disciplines have a body of accumulated specialist knowledge referring
                    to their object of research, which is specific to them and not generally
                    shared with another discipline. </li>
                <li>Disciplines have theories and concepts that can organize the
                    accumulated specialist knowledge effectively. </li>
                <li> Disciplines use specific terminologies or a specific technical language
                    adjusted to their research object. </li>
                <li> Disciplines have developed specific research methods according to
                    their specific research requirements; and maybe most crucially </li>
                <li>Disciplines must have some institutional manifestation in the form of
                    subjects taught at universities or colleges, respective academic
                    departments and professional associations connected to it </li>
                <li> Only through institutionalizations are disciplines
                    able to reproduce themselves ‘from one generation
                    to the next by means of specific educational
                    preparation’ A new discipline is therefore usually
                    founded by the way of creating a professorial chair
                    devoted to it at an established university </li>
                <li> Not all disciplines have all of the aforementioned
                    six characteristics. For example, English literature
                    has the problem that it lacks both a unifying
                    theoretical paradigm and method and a definable
                    stable object of research, but it still passes as an
                    academic discipline. </li>
            </ul>
            <i>Each and every discipline has definite characteristics for itself.
                Disciplines are separated from each other revealed to its
                characteristics. Generally, the characteristics of disciplines are as
                follows:
            </i>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Own content:</b> Every discipline has own specific content
                    or subject matters or course of study at different level of
                    teaching. </li>
                <li> <b>It is related to some professional and social activity:</b> Various disciplines are related to
                    different sectors
                    of professions with their activities such as agricultural
                    discipline is related to farming, psychology is related to
                    behavior of human being and chemistry is related to
                    matters. Likewise, teaching is related to profession of
                    academic knowledge, skills and attitudes. </li>
                <li><b>Every discipline has it's own method of study</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are different methods to study to their
                            various types of discipline. </li>
                        <li>For examples, for the study of the contents of
                            physics and chemistry, especially used laboratory
                            and experimental methods </li>
                        <li>Library is used for the study of history and
                            political science. On the study of discipline of
                            education, we can especially prefer and use
                            descriptive method, discussion method and field
                            trip method etc as far as possible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> <b> Each discipline has it's own field of investigation</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each and every discipline has its own sectors of
                            investigation such as biology is related to the study
                            of animals; Botany is related to investigate
                            different categories of plants. </li>
                        <li> Similarly, education discipline is also related to
                            investigate our society and education system,
                            education and psychology, education and teaching
                            child or pedagogy, philosophy and others aspects
                            that are the central points of investigation of each
                            discipline.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>each discipline has its own method of investigation</b>
                <ul>
                    <li> Each and every discipline of education has
                        its own frame of investigation and definite
                        method of study. </li>
                    <li> For examples, the subject of pure science is
                        used the experiment or laboratory method for
                        study. On the social sciences, for in-depth
                        investigation, most of the scholars are used
                        survey method. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
