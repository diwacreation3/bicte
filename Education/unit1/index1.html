                <ul>
                    <li>  Disciplines then have to be considered to be considerable
                        barriers to free thinking and an obstacle to more self-governed
                        subjectivities, which became the focus of Foucault’s later work.</li>
                    <li>  The term ‘academic discipline’ certainly incorporates many
                        elements of the meaning of ‘discipline’ discussed above. At the
                        same time, it has also become a technical term for the
                        organization of learning and the systematic production of new
                        knowledge.</li>
                    <li> Often disciplines are identified with taught subjects, but clearly
                        not every subject taught at university can be called a discipline. </li>
                    <li> There is more to disciplines than the fact that something is a
                        subject taught in an academic setting </li>
                    <li> In fact, there is a whole list of criteria and characteristics, which
                        indicate whether a subject is indeed a distinct discipline. </li>
                </ul>
