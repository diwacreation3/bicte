            from primary school to university and includes specialized program for vocational,
            technical and professional training. It is conducted in a certain space within a certain
            time to attain pre-determined objectives by the direction of programmed curriculum
            and textbooks. The education system which is provided to offer a certain rank to the
            students on the basis of certain curriculum, contents, learning experiences, teaching
            learning activities, teaching methods, material, duration, evaluation and pattern of
            certificate is called formal education. <br><br>

            formal education system. It is opposite to the formal education. It is conducted in

            constructed in terms of interests, needs, necessities and aspirations of target group.
            It is skilled based and activity oriented education. For example; adult education,

            concerned to pass or fail the learners. Examination may or may not take place at the

            <b>3. Informal Education</b> <br>
            Informal education is truly lifelong process. It does
            not have a predetermined objective or curriculum. It does not have a fixed time
            or limit. In this education system, the agency that provides education, may or
            may not have a well defined objective and well targeted group of learners. An
            individual learns many things through his/her day to day activities, incidents,
            experiences etc. is called informal education. For example, a person can learn
            many things by visiting, hiking, watching, seeing, participating in different
            activities of social institutions and cultural ceremonies, talking with friends and
            peer groups, through different of media as radio, television, journals, magazines,
            newspapers, internet, social networking sites like face book, twitter etc.
            According to Cooms, informal education as' the lifelong process by which every
            person acquires and accumulates knowledge, skill, attitude and insights from
            daily experience and exposure to environment.'

            <div class="title">1.5 Nature of Education</div>
            <div class="texts">
                The nature of education is based on goals, motivation,
                attitudes, methods, activities or learning efforts and attempts. Nature is the essential quality
                or characteristics by which something is recognized. The nature of education is quite
                dependent on how the people perceive it, how this system functions and what the
                outcomes of this system are. The following are the main nature of education
            </div>
            <div class="title">1.5.1 Direct and indirect Education</div>
            <div class="texts">
                When learners get education through direct ways, it is called direct education.
                Generally, when the learners learn from the personality, skill, concept, knowledge, habit,
                activities, behavior and other aspects of the teachers directly, it is called direct education.
                The formal class-room teaching learning activities where the teacher directly teaches the
                learners is one of the best examples of it. It has predetermined schedule and certain
                objectives, too. Here, the educator wants to teach something to the learner and the learner
                consciously learns what is taught to them. The educator may be a teacher, parents, a senior
                person or a group leader. <br>
                Education cannot be limited in to the direct delivery between two groups: teacher
                and student. People can both teach and learn in indirect manners also. Here, teacher and
                student may not be directly involved in educative process. Teachers can teach the students
                without deliberate dialogue. They can play the role of a guide or even a facilitator or inspirer
                for the learning of their students. Students can learn by taking cues from teacher's guidance.
                All this education can be termed as indirect education. The education which does not have
                any pre-determined system and objectives, and through which the learners can modify their
                behavior by learning in terms of their interests, needs, necessities and aspirations is termed
                as indirect educatiob
            </div>
            <div class="title">1.5.2 individual and collective Education </div>
            <div class="texts">
                Individual education is provided individually to a learner in terms of his/her interests,
                qualification, needs etc. The product of education is learning, which is termed as positive
                change in the behaviors of the learners in the form of modified knowledge, skill and
                attitude. This concept is related to individual learning. a teacher and a student interact
                individually, which results learning within student. Learning is purely an individual process
                and education is judged in the form of learning of an individual student. <br>
                Collective education is such kind of education which is provided for all learners collectively
                irrespective of their individual differences, interests, needs, necessities, qualification,
                abilities etc. It is provided by a teacher to a group of the learners to accomplish the same
                objectives which is especially based on social need in general. A group of students and
                teacher can be collectively involved in a teaching learning process. It can take place between
                students and students as well. Students can also share their experiences for their learning.
                Human beings are the social animal by nature. They have inborn tendencies to be socialized.
                They want to learn by others and want to express their individuality to others. This
                motivation pushes them towards collective education. Therefore, classes are designed to
                provide collective education
