                <i>"Sociology is the study of human interactions and inter-relations, conditions and consequences."--
                    Ginsberg.

                Some scholar’s hold that whereas great importance is given to the philosophical,
                psychological and scientific basis of education, the need of modern times is that due
                importance should also be attached to the sociological basis of education. The
                sociological basis of education means that in the educational organization due
                weight should be given to the needs, ideals and aspirations of society. In other words,
                by means of education social qualities and social feelings should be developed in
                children, so that they are able to discharge efficiently their obligations and enjoy
                their rights in such a manner that they are capable to lead their lives with self-
                confidence and self-reliance and are able to contribute their utmost to the social
                welfare and progress. <br> In this way, sociological basis of education lays great emphasis
                on the development of capable, dynamic and enterprising citizens of strong character
                who are able to achieve more and more progress and development by means of education. Before discussing
                this basis in some detail, it is essential to know well
                about the various aspects and entities of sociology, society, community, socialization
                process and its social interactions to make the sociological basis of education are
                quite clear. <br><br>
                <b>What is Sociology of Education?</b> <br><br>
                This essay will firstly define education and sociology then it will define what
                sociology of education is and come up with a suitable definition on sociology of
                education from various definitions. This suitable definition will be discussed further
                because it speaks much of what goes on in education system. <br><br>
                <i>Peter Snelson(1974)</i> defines education as a condition of human Survival. It is the
                means where by one generation. Transmits the wisdom, knowledge and experience
                which prepares the next generation for life duties and pleasure. This definition on
                education helps us to act with more insight and more intelligence in molding the
                youth in an acceptable manner. We can give a sound academic mission to the youth
                by teaching them survival skills such as carpentry, pottery, basketry and other
                survival skills which can better their lives. Human beings not only acquire new skills
                but also from the society. To this effect parents and teachers should work hand in
                hand in order to help the youths themselves have knowledge and in coming up with
                relevant ways it’s a matter of assisting them. By teaching the young ones, knowledge
                is transmitted from one generation to the next. This simply enlightens us that
                education is a continuous process. The statement “sky is the limit” helps us to have
                a wide knowledge about all aspects of education. Education prepares individuals to
                do things it is their responsibility to do them. For instance parents have the duty to
                teach children good morals in order to prepare them for the challenges ahead.
                It is of paramount importance to define sociology before defining sociology of
                education. This is because sociology is related to sociology of education. Auguste
                Comte was the first man to come up with the term sociology, which means “the study
                of society”. A society is where a group of people live as a community. A society
                could be a village, a school, a rest house, a college or a university. All these units of
                society mentioned are part of the human beings and their social environment. Human
                beings belong to different groups where socialization takes place and they have
                influence on others. <br><br>
                <i>Ezewa(1990) </i> defines sociology of education as “a scientific study of human
                behavior in groups having for its aim the convening of regularities and order in each
                behavior and expressing these sceneries as theoretical propositions that describe a
                wide variety of patterns of behavior in learning environment”. This definition shows
                that there is a very close relationship between the individual and the society. It looks
                at how children become fully-fledged socialization. Furthermore, the definition talks
                about social relations in a learning environment and network of such relations which
                are known as society. <br><br>
                <i>Peter Harold(1968)</i> defines sociology of education as “the study of origins,
                organizations, institutions and development of human society”. His definition refers
                to the study of sociology of education by using the historical approach. It studies
                initial specific conditions. For any institution, organization or society to develop
                properly there is needed to trace the origin or background. In other words this
                approach explains how society and the institution develop. It looks at interactions
                within the society and also society and other institutions. There are also possible
                outcomes or achievements of these interactions <br><br>
                <i>Emile Durkheim(1858-1971) </i> who is regarded as the ‘father’ of sociology of
                education clearly defines sociology of education as “a systematic study sociological
                perspective”. This definition of sociology of education is suitable because it speaks
                much of what goes on in education system. It clearly states that it is important to
                know sociology before knowing what sociology of education is. This is because
                sociology is related to sociology of education. <br><br>
                <b>C. Nature of Society</b> <br><br>
                Before a fuller understanding of sociological basis of education is achieved, it is
                essential to know full well the meaning of society. We can explain society as a state
                of fellow-feeling, co-operation, friendship and sympathy among two or more
                persons who live together with common feelings, bonds and aspirations. By this
                implication, a society is an organization of persons which guarantees security to the
                members for their individuality and existence. MacIver and page rightly remark-
                “Man is dependent on society for protection, comfort, nurture, equipment,
                opportunity and the multitude of definite services which society provides. He is
                dependent upon society for the content of his thoughts, his dreams, his aspirations
                even for many of his maladies of mind and body. His birth in society brings with it
                the absolute need of society itself. <br><br>
                <b>D. Meaning and Defination of Community</b> <br><br>

                Etymologically, community is the combination of two words <i>‘Com’</i> and <i>‘Munis’</i> .
                While ‘com’ means together, ‘munis’ means <i>‘To serve’ </i> . Hence community means
                to serve together. In this way, community signifies the neighborhood of those
                persons who live together with bonds of unity on a certain piece of land and happen
                to lead more or less a common life which comes into being naturally and normally.
                Hence in the creation and maintenance of a community and the essential elements
                are two or more people, a definite piece of land, community feelings, common life
                and some rules and procedures acceptable to all members. Generally, it depends
                upon the economic, cultural and political similarities of its members. Hence a
                village, a town, a city, a nation or the whole common ideals, values, patterns of living
                in addition to specific geographical area, however small or big.
                <br><br>
                <b>E. Defination of Community</b> <br><br>
                Definition of community according to some scholars are being given below to make
                the meaning more clear- <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> <b>Ogburn and Nimkoft - </b> community may be thought of as the total organization of social
                        life within
                        a limited area</li>
                    <li> <b>K.Davis - </b> A community is the smallest territorial group that can embrass all aspects
                        of social life</li>
                    <li> <b>Ginsberg - </b> By community is to be understood a group of social beings living in common
                        life including all the infinite variety and complexity of relations which result
                        from common life or constitute it </li>

                    <b>F. Meaning and Subject Matters of Sociology</b>
                    <br><br>
                    The French philosopher August Comte used the word ‘Sociology’ for the first
                    time in his lectures in 1837 A.D. He organized various sciences into a ladder and
                    putting sociology on the top of this ladder declared it as a comprehensive science.
                    According to him, sociology is the synthesis of all sciences and as such it should
                    be effectively used in the reformation and reconstruction of society. Since Comte
                    advocated for the first the scientific study of society, therefore he is regarded as
                    the father of sociology. Besides Comte, other protagonists of this discipline also
                    contributed a great deal to its growth and development. Hence it assumed great
                    significance as a special and relevant study of society in a scientific way. It may
                    be noted here that discussion about the contribution of various sociologists is
                    beyond out pale of attention. <br><br>
                    <b>Sociology </b> is a combination of two words namely <b>‘Socio’</b> and <b>‘Logy’</b> which
                    respectively mean society and study or science. Hence sociology is the scientific
                    study of society or it may be called as the science of society. Man is a social
                    being. He is born in society and he spends his whole life in society. All social
                    processes and social elements and all kinds of social interactions are the contents
                    of sociology. In the following lines we are throwing light on the subject matter
                    of sociology
                    <br><br>
                    <b> G. Meaning of education sociology </b>
                    <br><br>
                    It may be said that Educational sociology is such a branch of Sociology which
                    has come into existence as a synthesis between ‘Education’ and ‘Sociology’. It
                    may be noted here that educational sociology emphasizes that the aims of
                    sociology should be achieved through educational processes. Hence the science,
                    after a thorough study of social institutions namely— the family, the school, the
                    community, religion, state, television, radio, newspapers and magazines, lays
                    down processes for the wholesome development of individuals through the aims,
                    curriculum, methods and other aspects of education. Thus educational sociology
                    studies all social processes and social interactions for social development and
                    welfare without which the nature and problems of education cannot be solved. In
                    short; educational sociology is that science which studies social activities, human
                    groups, social institutions and agencies which fulfill the needs of education.
                    <br><br>
                    E. George Payne is regarded as the father of Educational Sociology. In his book
                    <b>‘Principles of Educational Sociology’</b> he has discussed the influences of
                    education upon group life and the effect of the group life upon ed
