            <p class="texts">
                Socialization is an important process by which a child engages himself in various
                activities of society such as roles and learning of societal phenomena and
                developmental tasks in easy ways. On the activities of social work, he became a
                virtual individual in society. According to sociologists of <b> Broom and seizmic</b> , there
                are following two types of mode of socialization similarly, the concepts of modes of
                socialization are related to the ways adopted by social agencies to socialize a child.
                Social agencies generally use the following two modes to socialize a child.
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Repressive mode of socialization</li>
                <li>Permissive or Participatory mode of Scoialization</li>
            </ol>
            <b>A. Repressive mode of Socialization</b> <br><br>
            It is a parent-centered or society-centered mode of socialization. In this mode, the
            parents or society decide the pattern of behavior, which the children should
            follow. They do this for the welfare of the child. They develop a code of conduct
            for the child and they wish the child should follow this code of conduct without
            any questioning. This mode of socialization does not take care of the child’s wish
            and interest. It gives more emphasis on the execution of the discipline.
            Communication takes place in the form of command, which is generally one-
            way. It requires the child to follow the command fully without any question. This
            mode of socialization is less time consuming. It shapes the behavior of the child
            in a pre-specified manner; therefore, it tries to develop a homogeneous society.
            It makes the child more conformist rather than a creative child. A conformist
            child is that obedient child who tries to confirm the behavior taught to him or her.
            <br><br>
            They are just good followers. Repressive mode of socialization gives more
            emphasis to make a child a good follower of adults. For the development of
            prescribed behavior, it rewards the right behavior and punishes the wrong
            behavior. The reward in repressive mode of socialization is material and
            punishment is physical: <br><br>
            <b>Repressive mode of socialization refers to the following characteristics:</b>
            <ol>

               <b>Permissive or Participatory mode of Socialization:</b>
            It is a child centered mode of socialization. This mode of socialization respects
            the child’s wishes, needs, freedom and interest. Children themselves make their
            own code of conduct by trial and error process based on the theory of “Learning
            by doing”. Children are permitted to select the pattern of behavior according to
            their needs and make their own course of discipline. Society and parents play the
            role of guide in this form of socialization. The communication in this type of
            socialization is always two-way. Parent and child both communicate to establish
            the code of conduct. Although this socialization process takes more time to
            develop a particular code of conduct in this system, it makes the child more
            creative. Children explore relevant behavior by their own experience. There is an
            individual difference in the socialization of a child; therefore, it develops a
            heterogeneous society. Similar to repressive mode of socialization, it also
            <br>
            rewards the right behavior and punishes the wrong behavior, but the reward is
            symbolic and punishment is corrective. <br> 
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Laissez faire mode of socialization : </b>In this type of socialization, children
                    enjoy total freedom for choosing their code of conduct. Code of conduct is
                    decided based on the will and experiences of a child. There is no or very little
                    intervention of parents in the learning of a child. The child should be totally
                    responsible for him or herself. Such Socialization can lead the behavior of
                    child to both right and wrong. At present time, laissez faire mode has become
                    a common mode in many developed societies, especially for grown up
                    children. It leads to individuality rather that socialization </li>
                <li> <b>Democratic mode of socialization : </b>This type of socialization is more
                    planned and prescribed in comparison to laissez faire mode. Children are
                    socialized according to a predetermined plan and a prescribed set of behavior.
                    They are trained to respect others’ will while performing any activity.
                    However, they are permitted to learn all these behavior via their own
                    experience. Their will and interest is paid a regard, but they are taught to
                    respect others’ will and interest. </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Permissive mode of socialization refers to the following characteristics. </b>
            <li> Rewarding good behavior </li>
            <li> Symbolic rewards and punishment. </li>
            <li> Autonomy of child and positive development </li>
            <li> Communication as interaction. </li>
            <li>Verbal communication  </li>
            <li> Child centered socialization. </li>
            <li> Parent’s discernment of child’s wishes. </li>
            <li> New concept and participatory role </li>
            <li> Reward centered, freedom centered and interaction centered mode </li>
            <li> Two way communication </li>
            <li> Greater importance of individual </li>
