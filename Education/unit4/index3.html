                that are illustrated as under. <br><br>
                <b>A. Active groups or Agencies </b> <br><br>
                n these agencies, there are two ways communication held in society. They are
                actively participating to help individual and others in socialization process is
                known as active groups. For examples, family, school, groups, associations etc.

                categories. <br>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Formal group : </b>Socialization process has been conducted on the basis of
                    socially recognized rules and regulations of society. School, Social organization
                    and associations that are established in society as a form of formal groups. </li>
                <li> <b>Non-formal group : </b>Flexible rules steers on social activities and rules and
                    regulations may be changeable according to time frame. There is no any formal
                    boundaries of doing various activities is known as Non-formal groups or
                    agencies like home, family, peer groups and community etc. Some agencies that

                    are played enormous roles on the process of socialization has been explain as
                    under:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li> <b>Home /Family:</b> Family is basic agency, which plays an active role in the
                            socialization of a child.
                            Family is a formal group defined by sex relationship precise and enduring to
                            provide for protection and upbringing of children. It is so called as the first school
                            of a child is home because he born with in their families and begins to their pace
                            of initial life from home and their habit, attitude, behaviors, fundamental
                            activities of life are organized and share from the family. Child is born first as a
                            biological being and he interacts with his families and relatives and become social
                            being. On the consequences of their life he has matured and socially accepted and
                            making him change whole being as a virtue of developing personality. Thus,
                            family is active and first socializing agency. According to Ogburn and Nimkaff,
                            the functions of family have been categories on seven points. They are Affection,
                            Protective, Economic, Recreational, Family status, Educational, Religious. </li>
                        <li> <b>School : </b>Schools are the formal agencies of socialization. They prepare the
                            child to face
                            the problems of the future in a planned manner. They develop the character of
                            citizenship in them. Schools socialize children in a systematic manner. Schools
                            teach all the behavior which is needed for the child to be a responsible member
                            of society. </li>
                        <li> <b>Community : </b> Community is a group of people having common lifestyle. The people
                            belonging
                            to a community have a specific value system and lifestyle and they transmit it to
                            all new members of the community. They play an important role in socialization
                            of the young ones. The influence of a community on an individual depends on

                            the interpersonal relationship between them. It influences the behavior of child
                            to a large extent.</li>
                        <li> <b>Associations : </b> A person may be a member of different types of associations. It
                            may be a political,
                            a religious or a cultural association. These all associations are formed with a
                            specific objective. An individual becomes the member of any association
                            voluntarily on his or her own will. These associations spread a specific value
                            system and when a person becomes the member of that organization, he or she
                            becomes influenced by that value system. In this way, associations play an
                            important role in socialization of an individual. It is also an example of a
                            secondary group, which influences the behavior of the child in a specific manner.
                            The relationship between individual and associations is voluntary and self
                            motivated. This relationship also varies from person to person.</li>

                <br><br>
                <b>Mass Media</b> <br><br>
                Mass media refers to the distribution of impersonal information to a wide audience, such as what
                happens via television, newspapers, radio, and the Internet. With the average person spending over
                four hours a day in front of the TV (and children averaging even more screen time), media greatly
                influences social norms (Roberts, Foehr, and Rideout 2005). People learn about objects of material
                culture (like new technology and transportation options), as well as nonmaterial culture—what is
                true (beliefs), what is important (values), and what is expected (norms).
                <br><br>
                <b>Summary</b> <br><br>
                Our direct interactions with social groups, like families and peers, teach us how others expect us
                to behave. Likewise, a society’s formal and informal institutions socialize its population. Schools,
                workplaces, and the media communicate and reinforce cultural norms and values.
