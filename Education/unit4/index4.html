                <b>A. Concept of Social interaction </b> <br><br>
                Social interaction is all types of action and reactions that take place between the
                individuals and groups of a society and through which they influence others’
                behavior and also modify ones’ behavior. It is a two polar process in which a person
                acts both as a stimulant and a respondent. As a stimulant he or she affects other’s
                behavior and as a respondent, he is affected by other’s behavior. In this process, the
                people involved in social interaction influence each other’s behavior. It is the process
                by which a person learns social behavior. A person is socialized in his or her society
                through social interactions. <br> <br>
                Different scholars have defined social interaction as follows:
                <i>“Social interaction is the name given to any of the possible relations between persons
                    in a group or between the groups themselves considered as social units. It is through
                    social interaction the cultural patterns are passed on.”—A.K.C Ottaway. </i> <br>
                <i> “Social interactions are the mutual influences that individuals and groups have one
                    another in their attempt to solve problems and in their striving towards goals.” —
                    Arnold Green</i>
                . <br><br>
                <i> “Social interaction is defined as a social process when analyzed from the standpoint
                    of inter-stimulations and responses of personalities and groups. It is a process not
                    structure and is ever in the state of flux.” —Radcliff Brown</i>
                . <br><br>
                In this way, social interaction is a relationship between individuals and groups,
                which modifies the behavior of the people participating in it. Children learn the
                cultural pattern of society by social interaction. Socialization is also a result of social
                interaction. The two necessary conditions for social interaction are <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Social contact</li>
                <li>Exchange of ideas</li>
            </ol>
            <b> B. Patters of social interaction:</b>
            <p class="texts">
                Social interaction can be classified in different patterns on the following bases.
                These bases for the classification of social interaction are:
            <ol>
                <li>On the basis of number of people involved
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> Person to person </li>
                        <li> person to group </li>
                        <li> Group to group </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>On the basis of intimacy
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> Primary social interaction </li>
                        <li> Secondary social interaction </li>
                        <li> Marginal social interaction </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the basis of social process
                    Parks and Burgees have classified social interaction in the following four
                    types on the basis of social process:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Competition </li>
                        <li> Conflict </li>
                        <li> Accommodation </li>
                        <li> Assimilation </li>
                        <li> Co-Operation </li>
                        <li> Exchange </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
