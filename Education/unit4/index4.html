                <b>A. Concept of Social interaction </b> <br><br>
                Social interaction is all types of action and reactions that take place between the
                individuals and groups of a society and through which they influence others’
                behavior and also modify ones’ behavior. It is a two polar process in which a person
                acts both as a stimulant and a respondent. As a stimulant he or she affects other’s
                behavior and as a respondent, he is affected by other’s behavior. In this process, the
                people involved in social interaction influence each other’s behavior. It is the process
                by which a person learns social behavior. A person is socialized in his or her society
                through social interactions. <br> <br>
                Different scholars have defined social interaction as follows:
                “Social interaction is the name given to any of the possible relations between persons
                in a group or between the groups themselves considered as social units. It is through
                social interaction the cultural patterns are passed on.”—A.K.C Ottaway.
                “Social interactions are the mutual influences that individuals and groups have one
                another in their attempt to solve problems and in their striving towards goals.” —
                Arnold Green. <br><br>
                “Social interaction is defined as a social process when analyzed from the standpoint
                of inter-stimulations and responses of personalities and groups. It is a process not
                structure and is ever in the state of flux.” —Radcliff Brown. <br><br>
                In this way, social interaction is a relationship between individuals and groups,
                which modifies the behavior of the people participating in it. Children learn the
                cultural pattern of society by social interaction. Socialization is also a result of social
                interaction. The two necessary conditions for social interaction are <br><br>
