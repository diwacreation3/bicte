                    evaluation of educational process. </li>
                <li>Sociology attempts to ascertain the functions performed by the educational
                    system while education adopts the principles of sociology to improve its
                    functioning. </li>
                <li>In the modern society, sociology generates the data base which is consumed
                    by educational system to realize the goal of social life </li>

            <i>In short the whole process of socialization fails within the scope of interaction
                or the social act.”<b>—Kimball Young </b>
            </i>
            <div class="title">4.2.1 Concept of Socialization:</div>
            <p class="texts">
                Socialization is a process of making an individual social. In other words,
                socialization is a process through which society develops an individual according to
                its ideals, beliefs and traditions and bestows recognition as social being. In short, the
                basis of socialization is interaction. In other words, socialization means that process
                through which an individual interacts with other individuals and learns social ideas,
                attitudes and patterns of behavior. The individual, inspired by the ideals of social
                service and social welfare through interaction, makes himself well adjusted with his
                family, neighbourers and other social groups so that he himself becomes a true social
                being in the real sense of the term. In this way, the whole process of socialization
                falls within the scope of interaction or the social act. <br><br>
                A child learns manners, habits, friendship and many patterns of behavior and other
                social processes in the society. We use language which has got great importance in
                society. The child has to learn all these social processes, and then only he would
                achieve proper development of his personality. Socialization takes place through
                social interaction. In it, children come into contact with one another. This social
                interaction occurs on two levels. Primary interaction occurs among individuals and
                subsidiary interaction occurs within the individual <br><br>
                <b>A. Defination of Socialization</b> <br><br>
                To make the meaning of socialization more clear, the following definitions are
                adduced <br>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>J.S Ross - </b> <i>Socialization is the development of we-feeling in associates and the growth
                        in their capacity and will to act together </i> </li>
                <li> <b>Havighurst and Newgarton - </b> <i>Socialization is the process by which children learn the ways
                        of their society
                        and make these ways part of their own personality.</i> </li>
                <li> <b>Bogards - </b> <i>Socialization is the process whereby persons learn to behave dependably
                        together on behalf of human welfare and in so doing experiences social self-
                        control, social responsibility and balanced personalities</i> </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="texts">
               <b> B. Process of Socialization </b> <br><br>
            As discussed above, the process of socialization makes a child social. Among the
            various factors which play a vital role in this process, the following are the
            prominent ones :-
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Child Rearing -</b>The upbringing of a child plays a significant role in the
                    socialization of a child. As the way in which the parents bring up the child and
                    as the atmosphere which is available to the child in his early childhood,
                    accordingly the feelings and experiences develop in the child.   </li>
                <li> <b>Sympathy - </b> like upbringing, sympathy also plays an important role in the
                    socialization of a child. It may be noted that during infancy, a child is fully
                    dependent on his family for the fulfillment of all his needs and requirements.  </li>
                <li>  <b>Co-Operation - </b>Society makes the child social. In other words, the Co-
                    operation of society plays an important part to socialize the child. </li>
                <li> <b>Suggestion - </b> Social suggestion powerfully influences the socialization of a
                    child. It is a natural fact that a child acts according to the suggestion received
                    from his well wishers  </li>
                <li> <b>Indentification -</b>  Sympathy, love and suggestion of parents, relations and well
                    wishers develop in the child a feeling of identification with others   </li>
                <li> <b>Imitation - </b> The basic fact or in socialization is the process of imitation. This
                    is the most potent way of learning by a child. </li>
                <li>  <b>Social Teaching - </b>Besides imitation, social teaching also influences the
                    socialization of a child. It may be noted that social teaching takes place in the
                    family, among friends and relations who guide the child in one way or the
                    other.  </li>
                <li> <b>reward and punishment - </b> They have a great influence on the socialization
                    of a child. When a child behaves according to the ideas and beliefs of society,
                    people appreciate and approve his behavior. On the contrary when he does
                    some anti-social act, he is criticized and condemned by society. This type of
                    punishment weans the child away from unsocial activities leading him
                    towards proper socialization. </li>
