                The education system which was evolved first in ancient South-East asia is known
                as the Vedic system of education. In other words, the ancient systems of
                education were based on the Vedas and therefore it was given the name
                of Vedic Educational System. Ancient education emerged from the
                Vedas. They are supposed to be the source of Eastern philosophy of life.
