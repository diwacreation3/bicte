            <p class="texts">
                Western philosophies have their root in ancient European civilization of Greece and
                Rome. The introduction of the terms “Philosopher” and “Philosophy” has been
                ascribed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras. The history of western philosophy is
                customarily divided into six periods. Ancient philosophy, medieval philosophy,
                Renaissance philosophy, Early and late Modern philosophy and contemporary
                philosophy are illustrated in western philosophy. A short description of Babylonian
                philosophy and these related periods are presented below: <br><br>
                <b>A. Banylonian Philosophy: </b> <br><br>

                The origins of Babylonian philosophy can be traced back to the wisdom of early
                Mesopotamia, which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly ethics, in
                the forms of dialectic, dialogues, epic, poetry, folklore, hymns, lyrics, prose and
                proverbs. The reasoning and rationality of the Babylonians text “Dialog of
                Pessimism” contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the sophists, the
                Heraclitean doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogues of Plato. Thales is known to have
                studied philosophy in Mesopotamia. <br><br>

                <b>B. Ancient Philosophy (600 B.C - 500 A.D) </b> <br><br>
                Ancient philosophy is the philosophy of the Greco-Roman world from the sixth
                century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. it is usually divided into three periods; the
                pre-Socratic period, the periods of Plato and Aristotle, and the post-Aristotelian
                period. The themes of ancient philosophy are: understanding the fundamental causes
                and principles of the universe; explaining it in an uniform way; the epistemological
                problem of reconciling the diversity and change of the natural universe, with the
                possibility of obtaining fixed and certain knowledge about it, questions about things
                which cannot be perceived by the senses, such as numbers, elements, universals, and
                gods, the analysis of patterns of reasoning and argument; the nature of the good life
                and the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to pursue it. <br><br>
                The earliest Greek philosophers were the Ionic School, materialist philosophers,
                mathematicians, geographers and astronomers of the 6th century BC including
                Thales, his disciples Anaximander and Anaximenes, Heraclitus etc. Xenophanes,
                Parmenides and Zeno of Elea are famous philosophers of 5-6th century BC. There
                were a group of philosophers called as sophists at this time. The sophists,
                professional <i>“Teachers of wisdom” </i> of the 5th century BC included Protagoras,
                Hippias of Elis etc. Pythagoras was an influential philosopher of 4th century BC.
                Leucippus and Democritus were the founders of Atomism, the view that matter was
                not infinitely divisible, but was composed of small <b>“atoms” </b> . It developed a view
                which is identified as Materialism. <br><br>
                Socrates (469-399) initiated the turn away from the earlier materialist doctrines to a
                logical system. Plato (428-348 BC) was his pupil. His works are known only via
                Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle was the greatest of all Greek philosophers, founder of
                logic and many branches of science that was educated in Plato’s school
                <br><br>
                <b>C. Dedieval Philosophy( 500 A.D - 1350 A.D)</b>
                <br> <br>
                Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of Western Europe and the Middle East
                during what is now known as the medieval era or the middle ages, roughly extending
                from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance. Medieval philosophy is
                defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical Greek and
                Hellenistic philosophy, and partly by the need to address theological problems and
                to integrate sacred doctrine. Some problems discussed throughout this period are the
                relation of faith to reason, the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and
                metaphysics, the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.
                Philosophers from the middle Ages include Augustine of Hippo, Boethius, Peter
                Abelard, Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas etc. <br><br>
                <b>D. Renaissance(1350- 1600 A.D)</b> <br><br>
                The Renaissance (Rebirth) was a period of transition between the theological
                philosophy of the Middle Ages and modern thought, in which Latin began to lose its
                role of the standard language for philosophical discussion. The study of classics and
                of the human arts, such as history and literature enjoyed a new popularity. The
                concept of man became the central object of philosophical reflection
                With the loosening of theological criticism on though, the Renaissance renewed
                interest in natural philosophy via Nicholas of Kues, Giordano Bruno and Francis
                Bacon. This coincided with a revival of magic, hidden easy of knowing and
                mastering nature. Ethical and political philosophy was revived by the work of
                Machiavelli and in the utopias of Thomas More and Francis Bacon. Within
                Christianity itself, these new movements fitted closely with the Reformation. <br><br>
                <b>E. Early modern philosophy (1600 A.D - 1800 A.D)</b> <br><br>
                Modern philosophy begins with the revival of skepticism and the rise of modern
                physical science. Philosophy in this period centers on the relation between
                experience and reality, the ultimate origin of knowledge, the nature of the mind and
                its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for free will and
                God, and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy.
                <br><br>
                Main figures of this period includes Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, Spinoza, Leibniz,
                Berkeley, Rousseau, Hume, and Kant, Chronologically, this era begins in the 17th
                and 18th centuries, and is generally considered to end with Kant‘s systematic attempt
                to reconcile. Newtonian physics explained with traditional metaphysical topics.

            system, the roles of student, teachers and school are the major implication of

            Vedic education are as follows:
            <ol>

                    curriculum. </li>
                <li> Hindu philosophy is gave more emphasize to the role of teachers because
                    teachers is the place of God for developing moral and spiritual values of
                    students. Teacher is the most influencing factors of Vedic education and
