            <p class="texts">
                <b>5.1 Eastern thought: </b> <br><br>
                Based on their origination, thought can be classified into two broad categories: eastern and
                western thought. Eastern thought includes the various philosophies of Asia, including Indian
                philosophy, Chinese philosophy, Iranian philosophy etc. Eastern thought, at least since the rise
                of European influence in Asia, is often associated with western philosophies. However, before
                the global influence of European and American technological and scientific education, the idea
                of philosophy as rigorous science is not found in traditional eastern writings, which are for
                the most part religious and mythical. Some of the important eastern philosophies are
                presented as follows: <br><br>
                <b>Chinese Thought:</b> <br><br>
                Philosophy has had a tremendous effect on Chinese civilization, and East Asia as a whole. Many
                of the great philosophical schools were formulated during the spring and autumn periods and
                warring States period, which came to be known as the Hundred Schools of Thought. The four
                most influential of these were Confucianism, Taoism, Monism, and Legalism. Later on during
                the Tang Dynasty, Buddhism from India also became a prominent philosophical and religious
                discipline. Like Western thought, Chinese philosophy covers a broad and complex range of
                thought, possessing a multitude of schools that address every branch and subject area of
                philosophy. <br><br>
                <b>Indian Thought:</b> <br><br>
                The term Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: Darshanas), may refer to any of several traditions of
                philosophical thought that originated in the Indian subcontinent, including Hindu philosophy,
                Buddhist philosophy, and Jain Philosophy. Having the same or rather intertwined origins, all
                of these philosophies have a common underlying theme of Dharma, and similarly attempt to
                explain the attainment of emancipation. Some of the main Eastern philosophies are given below.
                <br><br>
                <b>A. Hindu Philosophy:</b>
                <br><br>
                Hinduism (बारहमासी विश्वास{ or a perennial faith) is one of the oldest major world religions. Hinduism
                is characterized by a diverse array of religious belief systems, practices and scriptures. It
                has its origin in ancient Vedic culture at least as far back as 1500 BC. Hinduism rests on the
                spiritual bedrock of the Vedas, and their mystic issue, the Upanishads, Common to Hindus
                belief is in Dharma, reincarnation, karma, and Moksha (Liberation) of every soul through a
                variety of moral, action-based, and meditative Yoga’s.
                Hindu thought is not a single philosophy. It is divided into six “Astika” (Theist) schools of
                thought, who accept the Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures, and three Nastika (Atheteist)
                schools, which do not accept the Vedas as supreme. These schools are presented as follows:
                <br><br>
                <b> 1. Astika(Theist) Schools</b> <br><br>
                <b>1. Sankhya</b> <br><br>
                Sankhya the oldest Hindu Philsophy postulates that everything in reality sterns from “Purusha
                (soul) and Prakriti (Nature). There are many living souls (purusha) and they possess
                consciousness. Prakriti consists of three qualities or “Gunas”, ie. Activity (Rajas), Inactivity
                (Tamas), and steadiness (Sattva). The world is to evolve because of interaction between
                Prakriti and purusha. Liberation of the soul happens when it realizes that it is beyond these
                three qualities. <br><br>
                <b>2.Nyaya</b> <br><br>
                The Nyaya School is based on the Nyaya sutras, written by Aksapada Gautama. The most
                important contribution made by the school is its methodology. This methodology is based on
                a system of logic that has subsequently been adopted by the majority of the Indian schools.
                According to Nyaya, there are exactly four sources of Knowledge: perception, inference,
                comparison, and testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these is either valid or
                invalid. Nyaya developed several criteria of validity. In this sense, Nyaya is probably the closest
                Indian equivalent to analytic philosophy. <br><br>
                <b>3. Yoga</b> <br><br>
                The yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the Sankhya school. The Yoga school was
                expounded by patanjali in his Yog Sutras. The yoga philosopher aims at developing the
                capacity to concentrate his mind on one subject on the exclusion of everything else and
                ultimately to concentrate it on ‘nothing’. The eight steps of Yoga are:
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Yama (The five 'abstentions'): </b>Non-violence, non-lying, non-covetousness, non-
                    sensuality, and non-possessiveness. </li>
                <li> <b>Niyama(The five 'observances'): </b>purity, contentment, austerity, study, and surrender
                    to god </li>
                <li> <b> Asana : </b>Literally means “seat”, and in patanjali sutras. It refers to the seated position
                    used for meditation. </li>
                <li> <b> Pranayama(Suspending breath): </b>Prana or breath, “ayama” or to restrain or stop. It is
                    also interpreted as control of the life force. </li>
                <li> <b>Pratyahara(Abstraction): </b> Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects </li>
                <li> <b> Dharana (Concerntration): </b>Fixing the attention on a single object. </li>
                <li> <b> Dhyan(Meditation): </b> Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation</li>
                <li> <b> Samadhi(Liberation): </b> Merging consciousness with the object of meditation </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="texts">
                <b>4. Vaisheshika</b> <br><br>
                The Vaisheshika School was founded by kanada and postulates an atomic pluralism. All objects
                in the physical universe are reducible to certain types of atoms, and Brahman is regarded as
                the fundamental force that causes consciousness in these atoms. <br><br>
                <b>5. Purva Mimamsa</b> <br><br>
                The main objective of the Purva Mimamsa School was to establish the authority of the Vedas.
                Consequently, this school’s most valuable contribution to Hinduism was its formulation of the
                rules of Vedic interpretation. Its adherents believe that one must have unquestionable faith
                in the Vedas and perform the Yajnas, or fire-sacrifices, regularly. They believe in the power
                of the mantras and Yajnas to sustain all the activity of the universe. In keeping with this belief,
                they place great emphasis on Dharma, which consists of the performance of Vedic rituals. <br><br>
                <b>Uttar Mimamsa: </b> <br><br>
                The Uttara Mimamsa School, commonly known as the Vedanta, concentrates
                on the philosophical teachings of the Upanishads rather than on the ritualistic injunction of
                the Brahmanas based on four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva). Vedas emphasize on
                “karma Kanda” greeting society to self-knowledge through the Brahmins. Vedanta is the
                essence of the Vedas, as summarized in the form of Upanishads. The most influential Vedanta
                thought, based on the Upanishads, considers the consciousness of the “self-Jeevantma” to
                be continuous with and exactly alike the consciousness of the Supreme or “Brahman
                paramatma”.

                <b>II. Nastika(Atheist) Schools </b> <br><br>
                <i>a. Buddhist Philosophy</i> <br><br>
                Buddhism is a system of religious beliefs based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama.
                Buddhism is a non-theistic religion, one whose tenets are not especially concerned with the
                existence or non-existence of a God or gods. The Buddha himself expressly disavowed any
                special divine status or inspiration, and said that anyone anywhere could achieve all the
                insight that he had. Most Buddhist sects believe on Karma, a cause-and-effect relationship
                between all that has been done and all that will be done. Events that occur are held to be the
                direct result of previous events. One effect of Karma is rebirth. At death, the Karma from a
                given life determines the nature of the next life’s existence. The ultimate goal of a Buddhist
                practitioner is to eliminate Karma (both good and bad), end the cycle of rebirth and suffering,
                and attain Nirvana, usually translated as enlightenment. <br><br>
                <b> b. Jainism</b><br><br>
                Jain philosophy deals extensively with the problems of metaphysics, reality, cosmology,
                ontology, epistemology and divinity. Jainism is essentially a trans-theistic religion of ancient
                India. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are its belief on independent existence
                of soul and matter, denial of creative and omnipotent God, potency of Karma, eternal and
                uncreated universe, a strong emphasis on non-violence, accent on relativity and multiple
                facets of truth, and morality and ethics based on liberation of soul. Jain philosophy attempts
                to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents,
                the nature of bondage and the means to achieve liberation. <br><br>
                <b>c. Charvaka philosophy </b><br><br>
                Charvaka, also known as Lokayata was a materialist and atheist school of thought with ancient
                roots in India. It proposed a system of ethics based on rational thought. This philosophy
                stresses more on individual morality than divine morality.
