            <p class="texts">
                Open learning is an alternative approach to education at a higher level. It is a non-formal
                approach to formal education. The institutions are established to fulfill the need of those
                people who can’t get higher education from educational institutions such as schools and
                universities due to many reasons. One of the reasons is that students should not attend
                the classes of schools and universities regularly to get higher education. These
                educational institutions function at a certain place, for a certain duration and time. The
                people who are engaged in different jobs can’t get an education from these institutions
                due to their formal structure. Institutions of open education are established to fulfill the
                needs of those people who are not benefited from schools or universities. <br>
                The basic principle of open learning is “Learning opportunities should be provided
                without delay” and “provide education when it is needed and take the examination when
                the students are ready.” The students need not attend the class, as it is needed in general
                schools and universities. They function by using alternative means for acquiring
                knowledge. On the side of manipulating human sources, the followings points are
                illuminated and established for taking open education such are:
            <ol>
                <li> Adult persons, who are unable to take higher education in the period of adulthood </li>
                <li> Those persons, who are eager to develop educational carrier and personalities </li>
                <li> Those women are engaged in higher education after marriage life </li>
                <li>Those persons, who are a socially backward, economically poor, and
                    demographically rarer racial group, want to take and advocate higher education
                    through open learning. </li>
                <li> The openness of the side of remoteness, where education can take from different
                    media and communication. </li>
                <li> Openness on teaching methodology. </li>
                <li> Openness to ideology and approaches or visions of learning </li>
                <li> Openness or no boundary of economic affairs. </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="texts"> The concept of open education is a new concept for Nepal. NEC 2049 has recommended
                the establishment of an Open University in the country and the Ninth plan 2054-59 has
                planned for the establishment of this type of university by the end of that plan. However,
                Open University in Nepal is yet to be established. Only some universities such as
                Tribhuvan University, and Purbanchal University are providing courses in open
                education, and NCED has established some open school centers in different parts of
                Nepal. Some foreign universities such as IGNU, and the Manipur University of India
                are also providing courses based on open learning <br><br>
                Open education is the demand of time around the world. In the ancient period, Gurukul
                education, Gumba education have not fulfilled the need and demand for education in
                society. Instead of it, school education is begun in society. For the time being, school
                education is also not fulfilling the need and requirements of society open education is
                emerging in the world. Generally, the concept of Open Education and its norms and
                values are developed on the following approaches such are: </p> <br>
            <ol>
                <li> Education for all(EFA) </li>
                <li> Equity in educational opportunities </li>
                <li> Life long education </li>
                <li> Continuing education </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Method or process of Open learning</b> <br>
            <p class="texts">
                The delivery approach of open learning is paced according to the ability of students.
                Students take their own time for learning a lesson. They learn through self-study using
                their leisure time. All students learn at their rate by using different alternative means.
                When they finish one learning task, they enter into the learning of another task. In this
                way, they finish the learning at a certain level according to their pace. When they feel
                ready to take the examination, educational institutions provide an opportunity for the
                students to appear in the final examination. After success in the final examination, they
                are awarded the academic degree, which is termed equivalent to the degrees provided
                by formal education institutions. With the rise in the field of information technology,
                many educational institutions and universities have provided online courses. A student
                can get a higher degree by utilizing his or her leisure time. Open learning/education
                provides a chance for earning and learning at the same time. <br>
                A true open education system not only provides a chance to get higher education by
                using alternative approaches other than face-to-face learning in the classroom, but it
                should also provide higher education to capable persons who withdraw the need for a
                prerequisite educational background. In true open education, a person should be
                provided an opportunity whatever he or she wants to learn without a prerequisite degree.
                Students should be allowed to learn any area of knowledge, and the institution of open
                education should accredit their learning if they become successful in the final
                examination. <br>
                The Open University was developed first in the UK to give everyone, no matter what
                the extent of his formal education was, and to provide access to the highest levels of
                educational opportunity. In this education, the method of teaching is correspondence
                texts, broadcasts and study notes, assignments, self-text questions, television programs,
                and computer practices. The courses of study include undergraduate courses e.g., B. A
                and so no, postgraduate (PG) e.g., B.Phil., M. Phill and Ph. D courses and post-
                experience courses or associate programs like short mode training programs.
            </p>
            <b>Learning Materials</b> <br>
            <p class="texts">
                On Open learning, various types of means are widely used to get multi-facet knowledge
from our surroundings. These means include correspondence courses, self-learning
materials, contact classes, contact with resource persons, contact centers, mobile library,
learning kits, programmed instructions, use of communication media such as radio and
television, instruction materials, etc. In open learning, students learn by self-study as
well. <br>
