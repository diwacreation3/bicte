            <div class="title">Concept of Compentency Based Educations</div>
            <div class="texts">
                Competency-based education has become a hot topic in higher education circles these
                days -- it is becoming increasingly popular as the country searches for ways to improve
                college affordability and more accurately measure student learning. Almost as many
                institutions are claiming to have competency-based education as there are definitions,
                so it seems worthwhile to define what competency-based learning is and how it can
                benefit higher education in the United States. <br><br>
                What is competency-based education and what makes it different? The most important
                characteristic of competency-based education is that it measures learning rather than
                time. Students progress by demonstrating their competence, which means they prove
                that they have mastered the knowledge and skills (called competencies) required for a
                particular course, regardless of how long it takes. While more traditional models can
                and often do measure competency, they are time-based -- courses last about four
                months, and students may advance only after they have put in the seat time. This is true
                even if they could have completed the coursework and passed the final exam in half the
                time. So, while most colleges and universities hold time requirements constant and let
                learning vary, competency-based learning allows us to hold learning constant and let
                time vary. <br><br>
                While competency-based education is better for all students because it allows them to
                study and learn at their own pace, it is particularly ideal for the 37 million American
                adults with some college but no degree. It makes it possible for them to come back and
                complete a degree, which can mean a better job, higher earning potential, and a better
                life. <br><br>
                While policymakers are praising competency-based education, not enough is being done
                to ensure that our rules and regulations support it. For example, financial aid rules are
                generally based on seat time, and accreditation requirements tend to focus on reviews
                of faculty credentials, course materials, and time measures rather than what students are
                learning. Moving competency-based education into the mainstream will require a
                fundamental change in the way we look at higher education in America, but the
                improvements we will gain in student learning, efficiency, and affordability will be
                worth it.
