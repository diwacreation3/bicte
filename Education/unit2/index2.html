            <p class="texts">
                When deciding on a career path, it's important to find out if your potential profession
                requires ongoing continuing education (CE). From massage therapy to counseling to
                law, many professionals must stay up to date through courses, workshops, or other types
                of CE throughout their careers. Read on to learn what types of professions require CE
                and how to get it. <br><br>
                <b>What is Continuing Education?</b> <br>
                CE is lifelong learning beyond a degree or certificate program that ensures professionals
                have the latest knowledge in their fields. For example, there are new advancements in
                medicine all the time, and patients are more confident knowing that healthcare
                professionals are required to stay current. The same goes for attorneys, who are better
                representatives because they must stay up to date on changes in the law and legal
                practice. <br><br>
                <b>Who Needs It?</b> <br>
                Doctors and lawyers aren't the only professionals who need CE - so do cosmetologists,
                project managers, and fire safety inspectors. Just about any career that requires a license
                or certification also requires you to complete ongoing CE. CE requirements vary
                between states, licensing boards, and certifying agencies. Here are just a few examples
                of careers that typically require CE:
            <ul>
                <li> <i>Health Care: </i>hysicians, nurses, dentists, acupuncturists, professional
                    counselors, social workers </li>
                <li> <i>Law: </i> Lawayers paralegals </li>
                <li> <i>Business: </i> Accountants, tax preparers, financial professionals</li>
                <li> <i>Beauty: </i> Cosmetologists, estheticians, nail technicians </li>
                <li><i>Other Professions: </i> Architects, engineers, project managers, safety personnel. </li>
            </ul>

                It is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities
                and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada.
                Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include
                degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce
                training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed
                learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs, or personal research activities)
                and experiential learning as applied to problem-solving. <br><br>
                <b>General</b> <br>
                General continuing education is similar to adult education, at least in being intended for
                adult learners, especially those beyond traditional undergraduate college or university
                age. However, it is not normally considered to include basic instruction such
                as literacy, and English language skills, or programs such as vocational training
                or GED preparation. Instead, as the term suggests, it is assumed that the student already
                has a college education and is simply continuing it. <br><br>
                Frequently, in the United States, continuing education involves enrollment in
                college/university credit-granting courses, often by students enrolled part-time, and
                often offered through a division or school of continuing education of a
                college/university known sometimes as the university extension or extension school.
                Also frequently in the US, it can mean enrollment in non-credit-granting courses, often
                taken for personal, non-vocational enrichment (although many non-credit courses can
                also have a vocational function). Also, in the US, many such non-credit courses are
                offered by community colleges. <br><br>
                The University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, in 1907, was the first academic institution in the
                US to offer what today would be considered an identifiable continuing education
                program. The New School for Social Research, founded in 1919, was initially devoted
                to adult education. In 1969, Empire State College, a unit of the State University of New
                York, was the first institution in the US to exclusively focus on providing higher
                education to adult learners. In 1976 the University of Florida created its Division of
                Continuing Education and most courses were offered on evenings or weekends to
                accommodate the schedules of working students. <br><br>
                In the spring of 2009, Eduventures, a higher education consulting firm, released the
                results of a study that illustrated that the recession had made a significant impact on the
                views of prospective continuing education students. A survey of 1,500 adults who
                planned to enroll in a course or program within the next two years determined that while
                nearly half of the respondents believed that the value of education had risen due to the
                recession, over two-thirds said the state of the economy had affected their plans to
                pursue continuing education. <br><br>
                <b>Method and format of materials</b> <br><br>
                The method of delivery of continuing education can include traditional types of
classroom lectures and laboratories. However, many continuing education programs
make heavy use of distance learning, which not only includes independent study but can
also include videotaped/CD-ROM material, broadcast programming, or Online
Education which has more recently dominated the distance learning community. Many
universities such as Southern New Hampshire University and the University College
University of Denver, have begun to offer hybrid courses. These courses offer adult
learners the option of having in-classroom and online learning. Online courses have
brought the possibility of obtaining an affordable college education to many of those to
whom it was previously out of reach. <br><br>
In addition to independent study, the use of conference-type group study, which can
include study networks (which can, in many instances, meet together online) as well as
different types of seminars/workshops, can be used to facilitate learning. A combination
of traditional, distance, and conference-type study, or two of these three methods, may
be used for a particular continuing education course or program.
