                Concept of Skill-based approaches to education
                Skill-based teaching is a process of developing efficiency in the fundamental
                components of teaching. It is a set of teacher behaviors that are especially effective in
                bringing about the desired change in learners. <br><br>
                Teaching is a skillful function. Without teaching skills, teachers can’t teach successively
                and effectively. It is necessary to merely use different skills for teaching learning
                activities by teachers. The use of different skills also helps the teacher with effective
                teaching and for students to learn simply. So, teaching is an approach to teaching
                students that are based on skills. Teaching is a skillful concept that changes according
                to the behaviors and social interests of learners as an individual. Skill-based teaching is
                a group of behaviors that especially bring expected changes in learners. <br><br>
                According to John Carol- <i>“Skill-based teaching is a process of developing efficiency in
                    the fundamental components of teaching.” </i> Such a concept is developed through micro-
                teaching in real classes. There are three stages of skill development: <br>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Congnitive Phase: </b> In this phase, we achieved different information about the content
                    of skills</li>
                <li> <b>Fixation Phase: </b>In this phase, without stopping error response skills will be
                    practiced frequently, or repeating functions will be done whenever skills will not be
                    set up. </li>
                <li> <b>Autonomous Phase :</b> In this phase, more and more practices will be done on whether
                    the speed of skill-based function will be strengthened as fast as possible </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="texts">
                Skill is a mixture of simple and easiest habits of learners that are used carefully for their
            ideological objectives. Skill is that functional types of knowledge that are achieved
            through training and practices. Skill is such special activities or methodologies that are
            used in the classroom by teachers. It is the interaction with human behaviors. Skill is
            those functions that are fruitful for a long time in their life. To make teaching-learning
            activities effective in the classroom and develop special creative tasks for learning are
            called skills such skills are lectures, question answers, discussions, evaluation,
            feedback, etc.
