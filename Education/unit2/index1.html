                <b>Concept of Distance learning</b> <br>
                Perhaps you’re already familiar with the concept of distance learning. As the name
                suggests, it’s all about learning from a distance. (Sometimes, this form of learning is
                also referred to as ‘e-learning’ or ‘online learning’.) <br> <br>
                In practice, it involves studying away from your academic institution, usually from the
                comfort of your home. The flexibility of distance learning makes it a popular, appealing
                option: you can study at your own pace, fitting your studies around your life. For busy
                people, this form of learning is the ideal alternative to being physically on campus at
                a brick university. Think of being ‘off-campus’ as the new ‘on campuses.
                Distance learning is an instructional system in which the learner is separated from the
                institution organizing the instruction by space and or time. Communication in distance
                education uses various media “i.e.,.print, audiovisual materials, radio, television,
                computer software” (UNESCO 1987) <br> <br>
                Distance education is developing on the principles of education for all, equity in
                educational opportunities, and life-long education. Traditionally, correspondence
                education was thought of as distance education or learning. But with the opening of the
                British Open University in 1969, the concept of Distance Education as distinct from
                correspondence education was developed. <br> <br>
                The Term ‘Distance Learning’ denotes a form of study not supervised by teachers
                present in the classroom but supported by tutors and organizations situated at a distance
                from the student. It incorporates education through correspondence but goes beyond it
                and is not restricted to education through the written word. Printed lessons, audio
                recordings, radio, T.V., video, telephone, computers, etc. are employed as media in
                distance education. We may hope that distance education may enable us in Nepal to
                achieve a learning society. <br><br>
                Distance education means education, as well as education, is taken from far stay in
                remote places causes of geographical factors that are similar to education taken from
                urban learners on the same opportunities according to their learner's needs and interests
                are termed as distance learning. <br>
                The programs which are taken on staying life on the backwardness of the remote area
                of countries can be conducted against the following causes of educational programs that
                are known as distance learning causes are:
            <ol>
                <li>Learners stay in a remote area or far from the city area </li>
                <li>Any household problems or problems of professions where they are engaging
                    regularly </li>
                <li>Learners who are unable to take regular classes or formal education </li>

                <li>Untrained teachers who can share responsible in their working places have taken
                    such training as well. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="texts"> Distance learning is the new form of aggregation of various experiences in the field
                of education. To achieve education is the civil right of the child. Distance education
                is necessary for us for the following reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li> To remove dissimilarities in the field of education </li>
                    <li> To provide education for all </li>
                    <li> To improve the quality of education </li>
                    <li> To make education relevant and pratical </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

                Similarly, Formal and Non-formal education both are the broadcast on radio for
quality education in developing countries like Nepal. In Nepal, radio was used for
teacher training programs since 1980. Instead of it, Agricultural programs, Police
awareness programs, Army programs, Legal advocacy programs, S.L.C preparation
programs, adult literacy programs, and B.B.C correspondence programs, etc. were
broadcasted through the radio in the field of education. Radio education establishes
the relationship between listeners and teachers or program makers far from different
places which is why it is said that distance education is a way learning process. <br><br>
Now a day, in addition to Radio, Television is also a prominent medium of distance
learning. Quality education is provided to invest much through diffusing educational
programs by television in a developing country. In China, Television University was
established and transmitted practical and literary programs interestingly. In the
modern age, television and telephone are interlocked with each other and manage
the telecast from the center and learners can learn from their peripheral area or home
easily. In this system, two-way communications will be established through this
system by teachers and students around the world in any place or country. <br><br>
In Tribhuvan University and Purbanchal University the department of education, one
year’s B.Ed. programs were conducted in a different discipline from 2058 B.S. to till
now which is the most popular distance education in Nepal. This program will help
geographically disabled and unreachable learners to get a Bachelor's degree in the
field of education.
