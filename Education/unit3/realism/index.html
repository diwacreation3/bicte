            <b>Concept/meaning of Realism</b>
            <p class="texts">
                <i>“Realism is the doctrine that objective reality or the material universe exists independently of the
                    conscious mind, its nature and properties are being affected by being known.” </i>
                <b> -C.V. Good</b> <br>
                Etymologically, Realism means ‘About a thing’ or ‘concerning some object’. Hence it is an angle of
                vision according to which things as we see and perceive are realities. Realities firmly hold that
                knowledge acquired through senses only is true. Hence what we perceive and see by our own senses is real
                in nature and the only true entity of the world.
                <b>Forms or Types of Realism</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Humanistic Realism</li>
                <li> Social realism </li>
                <li> sense Realism </li>
                <li> Neo Realism </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Objectives of realistic education</b>
            <ol>
                <li> Preparing the child or a happy and sucessful life </li>
                <li> Preparing the chils for a real life </li>
                <li> To develop feeling of necessities </li>
                <li> Developing the physical and mental powers of child </li>
                <li> Acquainting the child with nature and social environment </li>

            </ol>
            <b>Educative process of Realism in education </b>
            <p class="texts">
                Traditional system of education gave to the child only bookish knowledge which was purely academic and
                wordy. Hence it failed to prepare the child for real life. Realists changed that system of teaching to
                gaining knowledge through senses according to the child’s nature and capacity by way of observation and
                experience. Emphasizing that objects are real, the realists insisted to impart knowledge of objects and
                external phenomena through senses. In their opinion objects should be first shown and allowed to be
                handled if need be arise and then only they be interpreted and explained to the child. This encouraged
                the use of audio visual aids in education. <br>
                Bacon, the famous realist introduced the inductive method in the process of education. According to this
                method the object is shown to the child first and then its interpretation is done. In addition to this,
                the child does his own observation, experimentation and derives conclusions. In short, the child does
                self learning in a great extent by employing inductive method. <br>
                Milton advocated learning by travelling. John Locke also spoke of tours, observation and learning by
                experience as powerful means of education. Some realists also propounded many maxims of teaching which
                discourage rote memorization and prescribed instead learning by observation and experience. It may be
                noted that realist regard all knowledge as one unit and thus advocate the principle of correlation
                between various subjects of studies. On the summing points of views, the following are the main learning
                process of realism.
            <ol>
                <li> Emphasis on inductive method </li>
                <li> Emphasis on observation and experimentation method </li>
                <li> learning br social contact </li>
                <li> Insight as the pivot of larning experience </li>
                <li> Educatiob proccess for the formation of expected behavior </li>
            </ol>
            According to Herbert Spencer the following activities should be included in educative process in realism.
            <ol>
                <il>Educative process as a transmission of necessary knowledge skill and information </il>
                <il>Educative process as self sufficient</il>
                <il>Educative process for the development of good habits</il>
                <il>Educative process for the development of good discipline </il>
            </ol>
            <b>Curriculum in realism</b>
            </p>
            <p class="texts">
                Realists are interested to encompass the present real life of the students to the curriculum. Useful and
                practical curriculum should development for providing education to make enough human life became
                successful and pleasant. Realists give more emphasis to construction of well equipped curriculum that
                might be developed good citizen and might be making civilized society. In order to this issues, the
                following points be mentioned as under-
            <ol>
                <li> Useful and related to the reality of life. </li>
                <li>Development of child’s interest, experience and habit. </li>
                <li> Scientific and specific knowledge oriented.
                </li>
                <li> Realism emphasized the natural science, politics, Domestic science, Health and Social
                    science(such as History, Geography, sociology, Anthropology, culture) mathematics, Literature, Arts,
                    Music, Panting, Sports and physical, philosophy and Psychology are included in realists curriculum.
                </li>
                <li> Seven liberal arts should be included in curriculum. It is categorized on two parts <br>
                    1.‘Trivium
                    such as Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic’ and <br>
                    2. Quadrivium such as Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy are setup in realist curriculum.

            <b>Role of teacher in Realism</b>
            <p class="texts">
                The role of teacher according to Realists is neither as high and neither important as the Idealists
                advocate nor as negligible as the Naturalists speak out, it is fairly important. The teacher, according
                to Realists, is expected to have full knowledge of the content and the needs of children. Not only this,
                he must also be capable to present before children the content in a clear and intelligible way by
                employing psychological and scientific discoveries, researches and inventions by others in various
                fields of knowledge. He himself should also be engaged in some research work or experimentation. At the
                same time he must inspire children to undertake wide and close observation and experimentation
                themselves so that they are able to find out new facts. Not only this, the teacher must understand well
                the amount of knowledge to be provided to each child at a specific time. Hence realists insist upon the
                training of teachers before they engage themselves in the teaching work in an effective way. The
                following points are the role of teacher as under-
            <ol>
                <li>To introduce the real world </li>
                <li>To decide the knowledge</li>
                <li>To develop good habits</li>
                <li>To develop appropriate environment</li>
            </ol>
            <b>role of students in Realism </b>
            </p>
            <p class="texts">
                According to idealists, student is a fullest mentally development organism. The position of child is
                superior in educative process of realism. Child’s mind is a kind of things which integrated the
                experiences; feelings of pleasant and troublesome events that are coming in our contact and efforts to
                search with assess his objectives in the present world. A child gives the meaning of experiences through
                the ‘self’ by effort of himself and he has felt to achieve the objectives on regard to his activities.
                According to realism, the roles of student are listed below:
                <ol>
                    <li> self integration </li>
                    <li> An individual with will-power </li>
                    <li> As a self-realizer </li>
                    <li> Social force for self-determination </li>
                    <li> Child as blank sheet of paper </li>
                    <li> Child as the central point of learning </li>
                    <li> Active to obtain the real knowledge of the world   </li>
                    <li> Active in learning by doing with self experience  </li>
                    <li> Active to findout and discover new things  </li>
                    <li> Readliness to be a good and successful citizen</li>
