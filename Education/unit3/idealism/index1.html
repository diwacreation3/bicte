            <p class="texts">
                Idealism pays attention to the entire experience of mankind. Curriculum is for development of knowing
                (Faculty of mind), feeling or willing (Will power) and doing (Self-Realization) aspects of the child.
                Inclusion of music, art and literature in the curriculum is necessary. Idealism does not consider any
                one subject as all important. Any subject that leads to the achievement of truth, goodness and beauty is
                important. <br>
                Whole structuring curriculum, Idealists give more importance to thoughts, feelings, ideals and values
                than to the child and his activities. They firmly hold that curriculum should be concerned with the
                whole humanity and its experiences. These experiences can be imbibed by two ways namely—
            <ol>
                <li>from the physical environment </li>
                <li>from contacts with other fellowmen</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Views of plato about curriculum</b>
            <p class="texts"> Plato was a staunch Idealist. According to him the aim of life is to realize God which is
                possible only by
                pursuing high ideals namely Truth, Beauty and Goodness. These high ideals can be attained by three types
                of
                activities
                namely intellectual, aesthetic and moral </p> <br>
            <b>Idealisms and Role of teacher </b>
            <p class="texts">
                Guru is Brahma, Guru is Vishnu, Guru is the Great God Shiva, and Guru is the real absolute. I offer May
                Pranam to such a Guru. Varied are the enumerations of principles made by the seers. All are legitimate
                as they are reasoned out. What indeed can be odd with men of intellect. <br>
                In the realm of idealism, the role of teacher is very important and glorious. Idealistic philosophy
                believes that this planned creation has two parts— <br> 1. The teacher and <br> 2. The child as student.
                Both aims
                at one target only—The development of the individual child in a spiritual way. The realization of this
                great aim is possible only through education and the essential agent, the teacher. In reality an
                idealist teacher is imbued fully with high degree of self knowledge, self dynamism and essential
                qualities of spiritualism. By his own model of life, he tries to shape the individuality of the child to
                a life of purity, virtue and great achievements. He creates a wholesome conducive atmosphere by his own
                activities and planned experiences for the child. He guides the child with such genuine love, affection
                and sympathy that he attains his full mental and spiritual development. <i>J.S. Ross aptly(Sunshine
                    State) remarks— “The
                    Naturalist may be content with briars, but the idealist wants fine roses. So the educator by his
                    efforts
                    assists the educand, who is developing according to the laws of his nature to attain levels that
                    would
                    otherwise be denied to him.” <br><br>

                </i>
                Teacher is the focal point of whole educational process in idealism. He bears more responsible for
                developing ideal life of students and made them good citizens of Nation. The teacher himself creates the
                educational environment for achieving educational aims and objectives in order to pouring more and more
                knowledge to the learner is the ultimate duty of teacher. According to Idealism, requirement of teachers
                are mentioned as under-
            <ol>
                <li>Role of teacher as a gardener for best development </li>
                <li>Role of teacher for verification of truth </li>
                <li>Role of teacher for self-realization </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="texts">
                The place of teacher in idealism is very high. No knowledge can be gained without a teacher. A true
                teacher
                removes all darkness, i.e. ignorance. The qualities that have been seen the teachers according to the
                concept of Idealism that points are as follows: <br><br>
                1. Symbol of realities for the child. Specialist in the knowledge of pupils. Excellent technician. As
                individual who commands respect of the pupils. Personal friend of students. Source of motivation. Master
                of
                Arts of living. Co-worker with god in perfecting man. An ideal person. Good communicator of subject
                matter.
                Maker of democracies and selflessness.

            <b>Role of student in idealism</b>
            <p class="texts">
                The educative system of idealism is not child centered like as Naturalism. It especially focuses on
                guidance of teacher as well as Guru to their notions or ideas are major space in Idealism. Idealists is
                impetus the following concepts in regard to the child or students.
            <ol>
                <li>A child as spiritual being/ a self </li>
                <li> Student is in the process of becoming </li>
                <li> Discipline as a main slogan because self-discipline,self-control and self-realization is most in
                    idealism </li>
                <li>A child is known as whole being. </li>
                <li>Student as a curious person</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="texts">
                According to idealism a child is not only a body. He is for above. Idealism says that he/ child are both
                mind and body in which mind is more important. Idealism does not consider the child as a mere body. It
                lays
                emphasis on his spiritual development also
