                <i>“Idealism contends that the material and physical universe known to science is an incomplete
                    expression of reality, that it exists but to sub-serve, and requires to complement it a higher type
                    of reality, a spiritual universe.” -Rusk

                <b>A. Meaning of Idealism (Concept) </b> <br>
                Idealism is the oldest school of philosophical thoughts it is related to spiritual philosophy.
                Idealism is born out of Plato’s <b>“Theory of Ideas.” </b> According to this doctrine, the ultimate
                supremacy is
                of ideas. In this way, the real word is “Ideaism” but adding the letter <b> ‘l’</b> for pronunciation
                facility
                it is known as idealism. Idealism is derived from Greek language <b> ‘Idien’ . Its meaning is ‘To see’
                    which
                    is related to idea, ideal and expressed it in ideology. </b> At end it is written as Idealism.
                According to
                idealism, the ultimate reality is truth. Soul is the mother of reality. It emphasized that soul is more
                important than maters. So we called it that consciousness is primary where as matter is secondary or
                matter is created by an idea. Plato is considered as the chief propagator of idealism and said in
                fantastically that ideology in <b> ‘Ideal state’</b> that ultimate reality consists of ideas. According
                to Plato
                ideas are the eternal truth. This eternal truth can be achieved by attainment of three spiritual values:
                truth, goodness and beauty. According to Aristotle, he mentions that <b>‘Man is the measure of all
                    things.’</b>
                A person should follow four goodness conducts to often spiritual values as self-Control, patience,
                Knowledge,
                justic. Western philosopher Plato, Socrates, Hume, Froeble Kant are the exponents of idealism. <br>
                philosophical Premises of idealism is given below:- <br>
                <b> 1. Two forms of the whole world </b> <br>
                a. Spiritual <br>
                b. Material <br> <br>
                <b>2. Ideas are more important than objects </b> <br>
                According to idealists, knowledge of mind and soul can be obtained through ideas only. Hence they have
                given more importance to ideas over the objects and material things. To them, ideas are the ultimate
                reality whereas objects die out sooner or later. In the ideas are embedded all the realities and
                ultimate entities of the material world. In the words of <i> Plato—“Ideas are of the ultimate cosmic
                    significance. They are rather the essences of archetypes which give form to cosmos. These ideas are
                    eternal and unchanging.” </i> <br><br>
                <b>3. Faith in spiritual Values </b> <br>
                According to idealists, the prime aim of life is to achieve spiritual values. They give greater
                importance to spiritual values. They are—Truth, Beauty and Goodness. These spiritual values are undying
                (eternal) and permanent. The realization of these values is the realization of God. In the pursuit of
                these absolute values man rises higher and higher in the moral plane till he attains divinity. For the
                achievement of these spiritual values, all the capacities of man are to be harnessed to the full. These
                capacities are —knowing, feeling and willing. By the fullest use of these capacities man can achieve the
                highest spiritual values and thus realize his true and ultimate self. <i>J.S. Ross also
                    opines—“Goodness,
                    truth and beauty are seen to be absolutes each existing in its own right and entirely desirable in
                    itself. </i>
                <br><br>
                <b>4.importance of man over nature</b> <br>
                To idealists, man is more important than material nature. It is because man can think and experience
                about material objects and material phenomena. Hence the thinker or the one who experiences is more
                importance than the object or the phenomena experienced. Man is endowed with intelligence and a sense of
                discrimination. Thus he is not a slave of the environment as animals are, but he moulds and transforms
                the environment for his own good and welfare of the society. In short, he creates his own world of
                virtue and his creativity achieves higher and higher levels of art in many areas. The following words
                speak this truth— <i>“The spiritual or cultural environment is an environment of man’s own making. It is
                    a
                    product of man’s creative activity.” </i> <br><br>
                <b>5. Importance of personality development</b> <br>

                Idealists give much importance to the ‘self’ of the individual. Hence they insist upon the fullest
                development of the personality of an individual. According to them, the development of personality means
                achievement of ‘Perfection’. Plato rightly speaks that each individual has an ideal self. He tries to
                develop that ideal ‘self’ more and more. This is self-realization in the true sense of the term. It may
                be noted that self-realization means knowledge of the self or soul. 
               <i> J.S. Ross is right when he says—“Human personality is of supreme value and constitutes the noblest work of God.” </i>

                <b>6. Full support to the principle of Unity in diversity</b> <br>
                <b>7. God is supreme soul</b> <br>
                <b>8. Self realization is the most importance for human being  </b> <br>
                <b>9. Man is spiritual organism</b>
