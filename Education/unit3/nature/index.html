            <p class="texts">
                The development of Naturalism may be traced from the earliest times. The material elements of the Nature
                inspired man from the very beginning to think. Hence, Thales thought water as the original source of all
                worlds. We are accepted fire, water and air as immortal elements. In Nepal also, form the very earlier
                times, Vedic seers thought about these immortal elements very seriously. As such, Nepali people began to
                worship as divine these elements of fire, earth, water, air and sky. In this way, Greek and Indian
                philosophy reflects in more or less degree the fundamentals of Naturalism. <br><br>
                In the 6th century, the Greek philosopher, Thales was emerged in notions of Naturalism; therefore, he
                was known as fathers of western philosophy. According to him, “The essence of all things is nature.
                After Thales some genuine philosopher was contributed to develop Naturalism such as Aristotle, Comte,
                Hobbs, Bacon, Darwin, Lamark, Huxley and Bernard Shaw were seen as propagators of Naturalism as earlier.
                Naturalism says that everything comes from nature and returns to nature. The major slogans of Naturalism
                are “Back to nature” and “Break the chains of society”, <br><br>
                <i>The western naturalism philosopher are:- </i> <b> Thales, Rousseau, comte, voltaire, thomos hobbs</b>
                <br><br>
            <p class="cen"> Naturalism lead to the following Beliefs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> The universe has always existed or had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.
                </li>
                <li>Life is an unplanned product of blind natural processes and luck </li>
                <li> Slow and imperfect evolution by natural selection is the explanation for the rise and diversity of
                    life on earth. </li>
                <li> Human beings have no independent soul or spirit, but only a material brain which operates to
                    produce a conscious mind.
                </li>
                <li> Mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and personal values, beauty, etc) exist
                    solely as the computational constructions of our brains, and not as things that
                    exist independently of us.
                </li>
                <li> All humans are mortal since the death or destruction of our brain cannot be survived.
                </li>
                <li> Humans developed (and are now dependent on) culture and civilization, because we evolved as social
                    animals. </li>
                <li> All conduct and behavior should be directed towards the pursuit of human happiness that being the
                    greatest value possible for humans.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="cen">The following are the main philosopical premises of naturalism: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> The universe is a huge machine. Man is also a part of this machine and a complete machine in
                    himself also. </li>
                <li> Life comes out of dead matter and is a sum total of physical and chemical reactions. </li>
                <li> All the capacities of an individual human being are delimited by his nature. Those are his innate
                    and inherent tendencies and basic instincts.
                </li>
                <li> Man, because of him own nature is the supreme creation of nature. He may be termed as the supreme
                    and superior most animal. </li>
                <li> The present life is the real life. Except this world, there is no other world beyond it, neither
                    any other life beyond this. Hence man should try to make this life happy and comfortable. </li>
                <li> Reality is of the external natural only. All objects are born or made out by this Nature and
                    ultimately disappear in Nature. Laws of external Nature never change.
                </li>
                <li> Unchanging laws of nature explain all the events and occurrences of the world.
                </li>
                <li> The true explanation of reality can only be done in terms of physical sciences.
                </li>
                <li> The changes in the life of man and his physical conditions are due to scientific discoveries and
                    inventions of machines and mechanical devices which promote all sorts of comforts. Hence knowledge
                    of physical inventions and discoveries is very essential. </li>
                <li> The ultimate Reality is of Matter. God, Soul, Mind, The Heaven and Hell, Freedom of Will, Moral
                    Values, prayers and Superhuman Wonders are all illusions. </li>
                <li> Thoughts depend on physical circumstances. They are activated only when some external stimuli
                    affect the body organ of an individual. </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Naturalism and aims/objectives of Education</b>
            <p class="texts">
                The aim of education is to provide comfort for the present and future. The aim of education is the
                training of the qualities of adjustment, modification and change according to environment. The aim of
                education is different for different naturalists. For biological naturalists, it is a preparation for
                struggles of life. For naturalists, according to physical science, the aim is to attain physical
                comforts. For Mechanical Naturalism, the aim is an association of natural tendencies and adaptation to
                matter. According to Rousseau, it is a harmonious interaction between man, nature and matter. Thus
                naturalism does not give any definite aim. The following are the major aims of education according to
                Naturalism:
            <ul>
                <li>Education should make human machine as good as possible </li>
                <li>Education to acquire present happiness and raising children </li>
                <li>Education for complete living and maintennance of Civic relations </li>
                <li>Education to acquire individual and social values and education to prepare for the struggle of
                    existence. </li>
                <li>Education for self-expression and self-preservation. </li>
                <li>Education for environmental adjustment, and struggle for existence.
                </li>
                <li>Education of social and political relations, personality development and securing the necessities of
                    life. </li>
                <li>Education for development of personal Freedom </li>
                <li> Enjoyment of Leisure and creating modern life related activities and ideas.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li> <i>Self-Expression: </i> It is the main aim of education. It means giving the child full
                    opportunity to express or reveal his hidden capabilities and qualities. </li>
                <li> <i> Perfection of human Machine: </i> Mechanical naturalism suggests that education should aim at
                    the efficiency and perfection of human machine.</li>
                <li> <i>Preparation for struggle of life: </i> Biological Naturalists believe that life is a struggle,
                    in which only stronger living beings are successful.  Hence the aim of education should be to
                    prepare the individual for the struggle of life. </li>
                <li> <i> Development of Individuality:</i>  According to T.P. Nunn every individual possesses his
                    individuality and Special traits.  The aim of education should be the development of
                    his Individuality
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Characteristics of Naturalistic education</b>
            <ol>
                <li> Back to nature </li>
                <li> Opposition to bookish knowledge </li>
                <li> Education a natural necessity </li>
                <li> Education-development of the nature life </li>
                <li> Freedom of child </li>
                <li> Child centered educational process </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <b>Naturalism and role of teacher </b>
            <p class="texts">
                Naturalists do not like those children should be taught in classes by teachers who are spoiled by the
                artificial atmosphere teacher, in whose close contact the child develops normally and naturally.  In the
                process of education, the place of the child is more important and central than the teacher. The teacher
                should not impose upon the child any things under his own authority or supremacy. The followings are the
                role of teacher in Naturalism.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>As a guide and a friend </li>
                <li>As a creator of natural situation</li>
                <li>Motivator of optional activities of child</li>
            </ol>

            </p>
            <b>Naturalisms and role of students</b>
            <p class="texts">
                Nature will punish the child if he contravenes the law of nature and thus he will learn by the
                consequences of his own action.  Thus nobody should interfere in this process of nature.  The child
                should be allowed full freedom to indulge in the activities of his choice.  The teacher should provide
                such experiences for free activity. The followings are the role of students in Naturalism as under-
                <ol>
                    <li> 	Child is the centre of educative process because the major aim of education is to develop the childhood. Learner is not a behaved as mini adult but being behave a child. Child is not for education but education is for child.
                    </li>
                    <li> A free individual to learn what he prefers </li>
                    <li> Use teacher as guide if needed  </li>
                    <li> Diagnosis of self needs </li>
                    <li> Main job is to create things </li>
