            <p class="texts">
                The main aim of education and philosophy is discovering knowledge. In education, observation,
                experiment, description and interpretation methodology are used but speculation, intuition, and
                imagination methods are used in philosophy for investigation. And formal logic based on a priori
                principles. Philosophy broadcast reflective thinking and no space of fantastic truth. According to

                <b>Fichte- </b> <i> “The art of education can never attain complete clearness itself without
                    philosophy.” </i> Similarly, <br>
                <b>Gentile says- </b> <i> “The process of education cannot go along right lines without the help of
                    Philosophy”</i> <br>

                <b> Ross- </b> <i>“Philosophy and education are like two sides of a coin.”</i><br> <b> John Adams </b>
                says <i> " Education is dynamic
                    side of philosophy. It is the active aspect of philosophical belief, the practical means of
                    realizing
                    the ideals of life.”</i> <br>
                <b> John Dewey</b> says- <i> “Philosophy is the theory of education in its most general phase.”</i> <br>
                <b> Herbert Spencer</b> Illustrates that- <i>“True education is practicable only by a true philosopher.”
                </i> Philosophy
                and education are supplemented to each other. So, Education without philosophy is like a blind whereas
                philosophy without education becomes lame. philosophy always keep in touch with education and helps in
                theoritical aspects such as :-

                On the end, we can summarize the following points to show the relations between education and
                philosophy.
