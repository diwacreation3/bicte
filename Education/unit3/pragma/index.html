            <i>“Pragmatism is a temper of mind, an attitude, it is also a theory of the nature of ideas and truth, and
                finally it is a theory about reality.” <b>-William James.</b>

                <b>Meaning of Pragmatism</b> <br><br>
                Etymologically the word pragmatism is derived from the Greek Word “pragma’ which means activity or the
                work done. Some other scholars think that the word pragmatism has been derived from the Greek Word
                ‘Pragmatikons’ which means practicability or utility. Thus according to this ideology great importance
                is laid upon practicability and utility. Pragmatists firmly hold that first the activity or experiment
                is done and then on the basis of results, principles or ideas are derived. Hence, pragmatism is also
                known as experimentalism or consequentialism. It is called Experimentalism because Pragmatists believe
                experiment as the only criterion of Truth. To them Truth, Reality, Goodness or Badness are all relative
                terms. These concepts are not predetermined and absolute. They are proved by man’s own experiences. <br>
                Further, Pragmatists believe that truths are many and they are all in the making. Man researches these
                areas only by means of his own experiments and experiences. Hence, only those things are true which can
                be verified by experiments. Pragmatists also hold that whatever was true yesterday. Pragmatists also
                hold that whatever was true yesterday; need not be the same today. Under these circumstances no definite
                and determined principle of current use can stop the world from moving forward on the path of progress.
                <br>
                Pragmatism is called consequentialism because any human activity is evaluated in terms of its
                consequences or results. If the activity results in some utility, then it is true otherwise not. It may
                be noted that the fundamental start of pragmatism is ‘change’. <br> In this sense no truth I is absolute
                and
                permanent. It is always changing from time to time, from place to place and from circumstances to
                circumstances. Thus those ideas and values which are useful in one set of circumstances, times and
                places, need not prove to be the same in changed circumstances, place and times. Hence Pragmatists,
                unlike the Idealists, do not believe in fixed, eternal and absolute values of life to be followed in all
                times, places and circumstances. They also do not uphold any predetermined philosophy of life. To them,
                only those ideas and values are true which result in some utility to mankind in a certain set of
                circumstances, places and times.

                <b>Pragmatism and educative process </b> <br>
                This ideology does not uphold any outdated, lifeless and rigidly traditional method of teaching.
                Pragmatists believe that minds of different children are different. Hence a certain fixed method of
                teaching cannot be useful to all. For the purpose of developing children on sound lines, both the child
                and the teacher should together think and formulate the necessary and useful method of teaching which is
                related to the interests of the child and involves practical work, activities and productive
                experiences. According to which teaching methods may be devised and formulated on the following points:
            <ol>
                <li> To emphasize the child centered educative process. </li>
                <li> Process of integration or correlation.
                </li>
                <li> Emphasis on learning by doing process. Pragmatists give more importance to action rather than
                    ideas. Pragmatism attaches more importance to activity and experience in preference to thoughts or
                    ideas. According to this ideology education should be imparted through activities and practical
                    experiences.
                </li>
                <li> Emphasis on Project method that was formulated a solid and practical method of teaching by
                    Kilpatrick who is the ardent disciple (students) of John Dewey. Through this method, the child
                    learns by his own activities and experiences, the teacher only guiding and suggesting wherever and
                    whenever there is any necessity for such help. According to him, “A project is whole hearted
                    purposeful activity proceeding in a social environment.” Similarly, According to Ballard, “A project
                    is a bit of real life that has been imparted into the school.”
                </li>
                <li> Analysis of useful and useless things through experiment and practice.
                </li>
            </ol>
            there are some methods which are appropriate to use in different situations. <br>
            such are illustrated as follows:
            <ol>
                <li> Project method </li>
                <li> Methods based on principle of Child Centered </li>

                <b>Pragmatism and role of teacher </b> <br>
                According to pragmatism, the teacher works as a friend, philosopher and guide to the children. As such,
                he needs two qualities namely- <br> <br>
                1. Capacity to come into close contacts of children to know their interests and <br>
                2. Full understanding regarding the conditions and situations of changing society. According to this
                ideology, the teacher is expected to put before children such problems corresponding to their interests
                that they get busy in solving the problem and gain more and more knowledge by their own efforts. At the
                same time the teacher should also create such situations that all children are able to develop social
                interests, attitudes and habits for the welfare of whole society of which they are integral parts.
                According to pragmatism, the major roles of teachers are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li> Teacher as a important person </li>
                <li> Teacher as a guide and helper </li>
                <li> Teacher as a creator of new ideas </li>
                <li> Teacher as a creator or learning environment according to capacity and necessity of the child </li>
                <li> A person who respects the freedom of learner </li>
                <li> A person who works as a member of students group.
                </li>
                <li> Teacher as a evaluator of capacities and needs of learners. </li>
                <li> Teacher as a planner of education
                </li>
                <li> As a person of scientific tendency. </li>
                <li> </li>
            </ol>
