            <p class="title">3.1.1 Functions of Philosophy of Education</p>
            <p class="texts">
                There are four functions of philosophy, which can be also explained as use of philosophy. In regarding
                to change meaning and definition of philosophy according to reason, ideas, thought and experience of
                scholars likewise the functions of philosophy are elaborated and changed in terms of situation and
                timing. These functions are discussed below:
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Descriptive Function: </b> Philosophy explains the universe investigated by it. On the
                    materialistic world, human being felt, seen and faced the realities of knowledge that is explained
                    through the philosophy. The philosophy explained on the basis of truth or realities whatever It were
                    dealt about the existence of the universe. On the basis of it, investigate the general rules of
                    mysterious world. This explanation is based on its own findings. It also gives the verification of
                    its findings. It gives the full description of the knowledge investigated by it. For examples, we
                    believed that the human being like Ram and Krishna were the incarnation of God according to
                    religious traditions. We were going to explain speech or feelings about the god as real fact in this
                    world.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Speculative Function: </b> Philosophers made assumption differently about the realities of
                    objects that was investigated on the universe on regards to its truth. The assumption that was
                    verified on the ways of thought and self-system and perceived it in regard to logical system by
                    itself. God is everywhere on the universe and it present the notions that the world is conducted on
                    the basis of his notions and compliance by themselves. That means there is something which handles
                    everything. Matters create everything according to the materialism. This function is known as
                    speculative function of Philosophy. <br>
                    Philosophy also presents its guess about the unknown world. This guessing is not haphazard but it is
                    systematic. Philosophy uses logic for the function of speculation. This function is related to the
                    predication of knowledge and also to assist the systematic investigation of knowledge. Speculation
                    or guessing is the beginning of philosophy.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Prescriptive or normative Function: </b> Philosophy not only presents the truth, it also tells
                    human beings about their duties. It does not tell only what is it, it also tells what should be
                    done. It develops the value system which should be followed by human beings. It establishes ideas,
                    standard of moral behavior, social duties etc. It is also called the normative function. </li>
                <li> <b>Analytical function or function of criticism: </b> Analytical function is also called the
                    function of criticism of philosophy. It analyzes truth and untruth. It analyzes the truth into
                    positive and negative category. It also analyzes the strength and weakness in human conduct. It also
                    analyzes the relationship between existing knowledge. This function is categorized truth and untruth
                    or value judgment on the basis of realities. On the above discussion, we can summarize the following
                    points about the function of philosophy.
                <ol type="i">
                    <li> Philosophy  discovers knowledge. </li>
                    <li> Philosophy   discovers and presents an explanation of the universe in terms of one or more unifying principles.
                    </li>
                    <li> Present a guide to conduct. </li>
                    <li>Evaluates and interprets the assumptions and findings of science.  </li>
                    <i> Instead of these above mentioned points of function of philosophy, we illustrate and perform various functions of philosophy of education on the followings. </i>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> <b> Determining the aims of education: </b> <br> Philosophy of education provides original ideas regarding all aspects of education particularly educational aims. It is said that educational philosophy gives different views, but this situation is not harmful, rather it helps in providing education according to the need of society. The difference in view of philosophy of education reflects the multiplicity and diversities of human life. Philosophy of education guides the process of education by suggesting suitable aims from the diversities of life and selecting the means accordingly.  </li>
                        <li> <b> Harmonizing old and new traditions in the field of education: </b> <br> In the process of social development the old traditions become outdated for the people. They are replaced by the new traditions. But this process of replacement is not always smooth. It is faced with lots of opposition from certain orthodox sections of the society. At the same time it must be kept in mind that every 'old' is not outdated and every 'new' is not perfect Therefore, there is a need of co-coordinating the two in order to maintain the harmony between both. This function can be performed by philosophy of education.  </li>
                        <li> <b> Providing the educational planners, administrators and educators with the progressive vision to achieve educational development: </b> <br> Spencer has rightly pointed that only a true philosopher can give a practical shape to education. Philosophy of education provides the educational planners, administrators and educators with the right vision which guides them to attain the educational goals efficiently.
