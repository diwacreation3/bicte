                <b>Overview</b> <br><br>
                Philosophy means <i>"love of wisdom." </i> It is made up of two Greek words, <i>philo, </i> meaning <b>
                    love, </b> and <i> sophos, </i>
                meaning <b> wisdom. </b> Philosophy helps teachers to reflect on key issues and concepts in education,
                usually
                through such questions as: What is being educated? What is the good life? What is knowledge? What is the
                nature of learning? And What is teaching? Philosophers think about the meaning of things and
                interpretation of that meaning. Even simple statements, such as "What should be learned? Or What is
                adolescence?" set up raging debates that can have major implications. For example, what happens if an
                adolescent commits a serious crime? One interpretation may hide another. If such a young person is
                treated as an adult criminal, what does it say about justice, childhood, and the like? Or if the
                adolescent is treated as a child, what does it say about society's views on crime? <br><br>
                Your educational philosophy is your beliefs about why, what and how you teach, whom you teach, and about
                the nature of learning. It is a set of principles that guides professional action through the events and
                issues teachers face daily. Sources for your educational philosophy are your life experiences, your
                values, the environment in which you live, interactions with others and awareness of philosophical
                approaches. Learning about the branches of philosophy, philosophical world views, and different
                educational philosophies and theories will help you to determine and shape your own educational
                philosophy, combined with these other aspects.

            </p>
            <p class="texts">
                <b id="metaphysics">Metaphysics</b> <br>
                The branch of philosophy is related to the search for ultimate truth. It investigates the nature of
                being and the world. It is concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world.
                Metaphysics is made of two words <i> “Meta”</i> which means <b> “beyond”</b> and <i> "Physics" </i>
                which means
                <b>“existence which
                    cannot be perceived by senses” </b> . In this way metaphysics searches for the truth which may be
                beyond the
                natural existence. The main questions of metaphysics are: what is truth? What is untruth? What is soul?
                What is God? Who is the creator of this Universe? How the universe was created? etc. It does not care
                about the utility of these truths. The main branches of metaphysics are ontology and cosmology. Ontology
                is the metaphysical study of the nature of being and existence and cosmology is the metaphysical study
                of the origin and nature of the universe. <br><br>
                Metaphysics is the study of <b> “reality.” </b> More specifically it is the study of reality that is
                beyond the
                scientific or mathematical realms. The term “metaphysics” itself literally means <b>“beyond the
                    physical.” </b>
                The metaphysical issues most discussed are the existence of God, the soul, and the afterlife. <br><br>
                The study of nature of man, nature of universe, nature of truth, nature of existence is metaphysics. On
                the field of metaphysics, it is studying the following aspects.
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Theology:</b> Study about the existence and notions of God, study about the various types of
                    religions that are scattered all over the world and verification is concerned in theology.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> <i>Pantheism: </i>God is everywhere </li>
                        <li> <i>Polytheism: </i>There are more than one god </li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> <b> Metaphysics regarding soul:</b> Study of existence of soul and life, relation of body and soul
                    are concerned about the metaphysics regarding soul.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cosmology: </b> It studies about the evolution and creation of organism or spirit that are

                <li><b>Ontology: </b> It is a metaphysics study of the nature of being an existance (Study of ultimate
                    reality) </li>

                <b id="epis">Epistemology</b> <br>
                Epistemology is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, and whether knowledge is possible. It
                investigates the different ways of acquiring knowledge. Epistemology is the study of “knowledge.”
                Epistemology deals with the process by which we can know that something is true. It addresses questions
                such as: <br>
                --What can I know? <br>
                --How is knowledge acquired?<br>
                --Can we be certain of anything? <br>
                Within epistemology there are two important categories—rationalism and empiricism. Rationalism stresses
                reason as the most important element in knowing. Rationalism holds that knowledge is gained primarily
                through the mind. It also asserts that we are born with innate ideas that precede any experiences we may
                have with our physical senses.  Empiricism, on the other hand, asserts that all our knowledge comes from
                our five senses. To use the terminology of the empiricist, John Locke, our minds are a <i>“blank
                    slate”</i> at
                birth. Thus knowledge comes from our experiences. There are following types of knowledge.
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Revealed Knowledge: </b> The knowledge that is propounded by god on the basis of belief of
                    religion is known as revealed knowledge. For examples, Ved, Gita, Puran, Mahabharata, Kuran, Bible
                    etc are religious epics that are assumed as main sources of knowledge but they are not either
                    verified or rejected in it in our life.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Authoritative knowledge:</b> The knowledge in which achieved through the books, specialists or
                    scholars are known as authoritative knowledge.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Intutive knowledge: </b> It is also known as internal or logical knowledge which is achieved
                    through high thinking level of conscious accidently is defined as intuitive knowledge. </li>
                <li><b>rational Knowledge: </b> The knowledge in which acquired knowledge through the logical ways is
                    expressed as rational knowledge. </li>
                <li> <b>Empirical knowledge: </b> The knowledge which is achieved through the sense organs like
                    touching, seeing, smelling, testing and listening are known as empirical knowledge. </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="texts">
                <b id="axio">Axiology (the theory of value) </b>
                Axiology is a branch of philosophy, which deals with the study of values and value judgments. The main
                function of axiology is the classification of knowledge investigated by metaphysics in ethical-
                unethical, just –unjust, useful-harmful category. It determines the ideals, aims and duties of human
                life. It prepares a code of conduct of them. It investigates the knowledge related to human welfare
                among the all eternal truths. The main branches of axiology are ethics and aesthetic. Ethics studies
                about a system of principles governing morality and acceptable conduct. Aesthetic differentiates between
                beautiful and not beautiful. <br><br>
                <i>Classification of Axiology</i> <br>
                <b>Ethics</b> <br>
                Ethics is the study of moral value, right and wrong. Ethics is involved with placing value to personal
                actions, decisions, and relations. Important ethical issues today include abortion, sexual morality, the
                death penalty, euthanasia, pornography, and the environment.
                <br><br>
                <b>Aesthetics</b> <br>
                <i> Aesthetics is the study of art and beauty or analysis of Beauty and Ugliness.</i>
                It attempts to address such issues as: <br>
                --What is art? <br>
                --What is the relationship between beauty and art? <br>
                --Are there objective standards by which art can be judged? <br>
                --Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? <br>
            </p>

                <b id="logic">Logic(Theory of orderly thinking) </b>
                This branch is related to make the systematic structure of knowledge. It is also known as the formal
                systematic study of the principles of valid inference and correct reasoning. It deals with patterns of
                thinking that lead from true premises to true conclusions. The branch investigates logical relationship
                between knowledge and arranges them in a systematic manner. It also helps in their synthesis. <br>
                <i> Logic is the study of right reasoning. It is the tool philosophers use to study other philosophical
                categories. Good logic includes the use of good thinking skills and the avoidance of logic fallacies. </i>
